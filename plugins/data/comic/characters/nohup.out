03:43:21 #logcabin <cortez> Eventually, she turned and strode purposefully towards the stage. She climbed the steps and crossed to the microphone with utmost confidence. Finally, I thought, we’re getting an update! The room quietened a bit. She grasped the mike and, amplified to the entire room, boldly asked us:
03:43:21 #logcabin <cortez> “DOES ANYONE WANT TO ORDER PIZZA?”
03:43:22 #logcabin <cortez> A cheer rose from the audience for some reason. This woman eventually began to poll us about which establishment we preferred, beginning with Pizza Hut. “We’re in CHICAGO!” yelled a voice from the back of the room, but he was unheeded, as her next suggestion was Dominoes.
03:43:23 #logcabin <cortez> I immediately made for the door. I can only take so much.

Me in front with my dad and my mom and brother in the back, fucking like rabbits (and trying to breed like them, too). We never seem to get anywhere!
04:31:08 #hugcabin <helloclarice> anyway I'm just having a really hard time divorcing myself from my emotions

04:32:32 #hugcabin <helloclarice> I even straight up asked my team leader about it and told her I was psyched to apply

04:33:13 #logcabin <Norse_Code> ok thanks
04:33:16 #hugcabin <Panthra> would you feel better if you got them to tell you the full story? or voice your concerns about how they handle this whole situation
04:33:24 #logcabin <Norse_Code> so you can't suck up water into your dicks like elephants and then squirt it out
04:33:26 #logcabin <Pacra> if you don't intake any vitamins/minerals for a long ass time and have a lot of fluid
04:33:27 #hugcabin <MoistVonLipwig> That sounds borderline illegal
04:33:33 #logcabin <sharks> good lord
04:33:33 #logcabin <sharks> what is happening
04:33:34 #logcabin <Pacra> you can pee quite clear
04:33:43 #hugcabin <Seluin> I think you'd be justified talking to the higher ups
04:33:44 #hugcabin <helloclarice> I feel like my only worth to this institution right now is that I am willing to work late hours at a desk for a very long time
04:33:46 #logcabin <Pacra> the opposite is if you take a shitload of b12

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
06:30:37 #logcabin <thongbutt> like a can't pass it up if I'm there
06:30:40 #logcabin <Linguica> i want to go on a trip to go see the chernobyl exclusion zone and north korea
06:30:53 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> Gallo Blanco for food, cocktails Bitter and Twisted, both places i have gone with ITV, she can vouch. 
06:31:23 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> if you wanna get legit street food tacos just south of downtown PHX there are great parkinglot trucks, off of central south towards buckeye
06:31:42 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> if you pass thru after 10pm there is a sonoran hotdog stand off of the freeway at Indian School and the I-17 that is great
06:31:45 #logcabin <thongbutt> I belive my hotel is in Mesa

06:33:01 #logcabin <thongbutt> I mean if it's not that far, I don't mind driving to PHX for food
06:33:36 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> thats really close to lightrail and good prox to tempe and my fave fave fave place in PHX Pig and Picklle
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
06:34:14 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> Pig and Pickle was started by gourmet chefs but has casual dining prices, so four star/3 diamond type food for $12-$16 + great beer selection + great snacks/apps as well
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'

06:43:53 #logcabin <Linguica> you are what you eat
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
06:44:42 #logcabin <thongbutt> woah, looking at pig and pickle's website, and it's a little bit higher that I wish to spend :\
06:45:04 #logcabin <thongbutt> I'm already spending like 900 on gas+hotel, kinda want to eat cheap to save as much as possible
06:45:15 #logcabin <thongbutt> anything a little better on a budget?
06:45:21 #logcabin <swolie> 4 chicken soft tacos at 7 am.  Bag of popcorn.  Rice and chicken at 11, rice chicken and fish for later lunch, bag of popcorn, rice seaweed soup italian sausage for dinner, a couple protein shakes
06:45:32 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> okay, cheap and good rather than Must Dines.
06:45:47 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> if you go to Gallo Blanco during happy hour the tacos are a buck off.
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
06:46:05 #logcabin <thongbutt> Actually, Pig and Pickle sandwiches look fine
06:46:26 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> their sammies can be fuck-off huge
06:46:33 #logcabin <thongbutt> Ohh man, BLT made with pork belly, might have to get that
06:46:40 #logcabin <thongbutt> blt - pork belly, mixed greens, beef steak tomato, pesto & tomato sourdough $13
06:47:00 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> charcuterie pickles and bread plate is a large meal for a reasonable human being, pickles and most smoked meats are done in house
06:47:21 #logcabin <CuddlyTumblemumps> their tostadas are totally underwhelming, dont listen to yelp hype.
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
06:48:15 #logcabin <thongbutt> so charcuterie or blt

21:19:17 #toronto <Typh> I was thinking that they define what makes them equal, so that must be consistent, but that's not true. Every object decides what it's equal to

21:20:25 #toronto <atv> oh i guess if you're operating in an "equal enough" mindset it wouldn't
21:20:31 #toronto <Typh> because (in Python anyways), it uses a series of checks for equality, the first being "check if the item on the left defines an equality method"

23:07:36 #logcabin <passthebutter> ooh, wils does have a point
23:07:53 #logcabin <kyaphone> My squat is about to pass my dl
23:07:59 #logcabin <kyaphone> They're equal 
23:08:03 #logcabin <wils> (i am deadlifting right now and getting depressed)
23:08:36 #logcabin <kyaphone> He was telling me I'd be good at sw if I dled 300 something

23:09:38 #logcabin <Norse_Code> pro tip: taco bell mild sauce on a hard boiled egg
23:09:43 #running <jld> i'll cheer you up by DLing
23:09:47 #logcabin <passthebutter> wils do you mix in sumo w conv deadlift training and/or vice/versa
23:09:49 #running <jld> w/ the 10lb bumpers
23:09:53 #running <jld> and still injuring myself
23:09:55 #logcabin <passthebutter> lol pocket egg sauce
23:10:04 #logcabin <Norse_Code> pocket sauce, pocket egg
23:10:19 #yossec <lamborgh> the real question/problem is, how many of these people are actually aware of, on any level, what they are even doing 
23:10:23 #logcabin <kyaphone> He said women my size compete in it but I only think of cc sized women 
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
23:10:43 #logcabin <wils> i've never done sumo
23:10:52 #logcabin <wils> and i don't do conventional very often either
23:11:36 #running <wils> not a fair comparison!
23:11:38 #yossec <afreak> and the other question is: when will someone die because of him?
23:11:49 #running <jld> maybe fall forwards into the bar
23:11:53 #running <jld> lose some teeth
23:11:56 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> Oh god

11:57:09 #logcabin <Erica_> What's up?
11:57:19 #logcabin <Erica_> Power tools or people?

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:58:54 #logcabin <Erica_> I like to think no one has a reason to kill me 
11:59:14 #logcabin <saa> yeah see it only really punishes awful people 
11:59:43 #logcabin <Erica_> The rapey part would be a bit troubling though
12:00:02 #logcabin <cortez> or would it
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
12:00:14 #logcabin <Erica_> That's what hand guns are for I guess 
12:00:25 #logcabin <Erica_> Just a teeny bit Cortez
12:00:49 #logcabin <saa> i dont think rape is legal, just murder
12:01:21 #logcabin <Erica_> I thought it was a free for all
12:01:28 #logcabin <poopwang> murder is legal tha tnight
12:01:28 #logcabin <dv> if it's the purge
12:01:30 #logcabin <poopwang> but rape is off limits?

12:01:43 #logcabin <saa> oh is it all crime? i must be misinterpreting it
12:01:58 #logcabin <dv> well the movie is mostly about rich ppl killing poor ppl
12:02:01 #logcabin <Erica_> What about long lasting crime like insider trading or money laundering?!
12:02:02 #logcabin <dv> so it'd be easy to get confused

13:16:34 #logcabin <poopwang> frank!
13:16:35 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I hope so, I worried I was making a terrible decision
13:16:37 #logcabin <BurritoKing> and fucking myself over
13:16:46 #logcabin <poopwang> remember on friends when joeys tailor fondled him
13:16:48 #logcabin <BurritoKing> but everyone loves this tailor and says he can work miracles with off the shelf stuff
13:17:05 #logcabin <poopwang> frank whom i need a suit someday
13:17:10 #logcabin <BurritoKing> my concern was just that off the rack is terrible and I was always told not to do it
13:17:10 #logcabin <Susical> if he's been doing it a while, i'd trust him
13:17:27 #logcabin <BurritoKing> but he took measurements, figured out he has to take it in at certain places, etc
13:17:31 #logcabin <Tenchrono> Hehe poopwang that was a good episode
13:17:36 #logcabin <BurritoKing> he just didn't take TONS of measurements so I got nervous
13:17:44 #logcabin <BurritoKing> but I suspect that guy can just fucking look at you and write down what needs doing
13:17:50 #logcabin <Susical> ya
13:17:56 #logcabin <Susical> was he an old guy
13:17:59 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I made it clear to him I don't have a goddamn clue
13:18:04 #logcabin <BurritoKing> he wasn't a super old guy, but on his way
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:18:10 #logcabin <BurritoKing> the place is run by frank and his son and nobody else
13:18:14 #logcabin <Buzkashi> old guys make the best tailors
13:18:19 #logcabin <BurritoKing> it's upstairs in a hidden place and looks like shit
13:18:24 #logcabin <BurritoKing> so you know it's successful by reputation
13:18:31 #logcabin <BurritoKing> he's been there 41 years
13:18:33 #toronto <teethgrindr> useful for comic nerds? http://www.wired.com/2014/07/marvel-comics-unlimited/

13:18:52 #logcabin <BurritoKing> http://www.yelp.com/biz/franks-custom-tailoring-boston <-- see, everyone loves him
13:18:54 #logcabin <Susical> $550 doesn't seem like THAT much...
13:18:58 #logcabin <Helios> maybe its just one big elaborate prank on BurritoKing

14:52:26 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> Freckles are small, flat, pigmented spots on the skin. They vary in color from red to tan to brown. Freckles aren't present at birth. Instead, they develop in time as a result of sun exposure. Freckles occur primarily in sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the nose and shoulders.

15:52:52 #toronto <teethgrindr> It's damn silent compared to the one with blues
15:52:55 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> Karezza is a way of connecting with a romantic partner via regular, daily bonding activities and sexual intercourse without orgasm. The bonding activities generate oxytocin and make us feel loved and connected. Orgasm avoidance keeps dopamine levels in balance and reduces the urge to look for a new partner or find flaws in our current one. Karezza lovers have frequent sex but rarely experience orgasms.

16:04:23 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> At first, he says, the task was painful, and he suffered from blue balls and frustration. But after he got used to it, he says he experienced a higher level of orgasm. “As a male, I was born to jerk to orgasm,” he says. “[Edging] affects my whole body and mind all the day…but there are beautiful and priceless moments. I can’t describe it, but it takes me to another world.”

17:02:11 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> About us: On our first date, I'm probably going to get a bit tipsy, smile a lot, ask a lot of questions, and convince you to do something random nearby like crash a grocery store and solve the puzzles on the backs of cereal boxes. Going forward, every date will have some unique silliness. We'll develop inside jokes. I'll probably sit on your lap a lot. We'll make awesome breakfasts in bed. We'll learn from each other and be
17:02:11 #logcabin <Mad_Wack>  lazy with each other. That's all :)

17:36:28 #logcabin <swolehalla> here's a video about it but basically there's a gene ABCC1 responsible for the type of ear wax you have and your distribution of sebacious sweat glands (sweat that secretes into hair follicles and feeds bacteria) vs apocrine sweat glands (secreted directly to the skin surface of just water and salts)
17:36:28 #logcabin <Linguica> also the way you phrased it makes it sound like youre not sure who the hygenist is but youre gonna make her your girlfriend no matter what

18:54:25 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> why ubuntu
18:54:25 #logcabin <Seluin> so I'm reading up on my friend who's going to have brain surgery
18:54:27 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> its poop from a bucket
18:54:34 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> centos is redhate without support
18:54:36 #logcabin <Seluin> The interesting thing about the surgery is that most of it takes place while the patient is awake. Only local anesthesia and a sedative are used at the beginning and end of the surgery. The patient cooperates in the surgery to give motor feedback, such as giving a thumbs up or moving each finger. This part of the brain controls Shawn's left arm primarily and may come near the speech center. 
18:54:36 #logcabin <Seluin> They will also ask him to identify pictures on a flash card. If the surgical team notices the patient loosing function, they will back off  and stop taking tissue.
18:54:41 #logcabin <BurritoKing> oh man, brain surgery
18:54:43 #logcabin <BurritoKing> Seluin no don't
18:54:50 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I'm scared I really do have a tumor
18:54:56 #logcabin <BurritoKing> he's like "welllll we'll talk about treatment in the future if so.."
18:54:56 #logcabin <Seluin> The downside of this tumor in the brain compared to other organs is that there's no brain tissue to spare. They could take a wide margin out around the tumor in other organs, but not the brain because that would mess up his motor control or speech. So there is going to be an effect as if they had to leave the roots of a weed in the ground. It is going to have to be followed up with chemo or 
18:54:56 #logcabin <Seluin> radiation most likely and then watched through the life of the patient. But the patient is likely to have a good quality of life in general, especially if they are young and healthy to begin with.
18:54:58 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> that's so cool and terrifying

19:03:52 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> In college one time we had an end of year party and all the students got hammered with the teachers (it was a small school, maybe 100 students total) and a the one guy was explaining that an older female teacher, call her J, used to be basically a star fucker in the 70's and was basically a famous groupie. It was super weird but she had mentioned 'knowing' Leonard Coen and a bunch of other 
19:03:52 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> famous dudes, little did we know she meant it biblically. Anyway it was kind of hard to believe cause she was fairly old and hadn't aged well but then one day she brought her ~23 year old daughter to the school and our jaws all collectively hit the floor (at least they would have had they not hit our boners halfway down).

20:49:06 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> I don't care about w/e is going on itt

20:49:44 #logcabin <polygon> where is kyashi fan club
20:49:46 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> polygon: catch me up, what are people fighting about?
20:49:53 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> I'm in Kyashi fanclub
20:50:07 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> it's 99% me sending her unwanted and unrequested dicksnaps though
20:50:26 #logcabin <wils> polygon: it's right here
20:50:30 #logcabin <wils> so it ends up not in her log
20:50:32 #logcabin <wils> for the most part
20:50:44 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> thats true
20:50:56 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> also Kyashi has a good log i.e. not full of fangirling bullshit
20:50:59 #toronto <robodex> I thought I was getting sick last night
20:51:04 #logcabin <polygon> MVL this girl posted something dumb about a) i know i should expect weight gain when i start lifting due to muscle increasez b) it seems like ppl who get body positive lose a lot of weight first, isn't it easier to like yourself if you aren't "a human ball of lard" exact words

20:51:39 #logcabin <polygon> i'm talking about what you were referencing, moist
20:52:07 #logcabin <polygon> randos who don't even log being like "WOW U ARE SO STRONG OMG !!!! U INSPIRE ME" at people just because they posted something not even related

20:52:31 #logcabin <wils> could kyashi be less relate-able
20:52:36 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> Well I think it's because the log doesn't have that atmosphere, it's very self-deprecating and aware
20:52:37 #logcabin <polygon> like abgushte is p strong and when she posts in that thread no randos are like WOW IT'S ABGUSHTE SO STRONG I LOVE U

23:36:59 #logcabin <Supple_Leopard>  step 1 get a coach 
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
23:37:56 #logcabin <Kyashi> for what
23:37:59 #toronto <nupogodi> i know what i'm talking about, i literally lived beside the 407 for many many years and drove it, sometimes daily, for many many years 
23:38:04 #toronto <nupogodi> my "stories" are valid 
23:38:11 #logcabin <wils> The power clean, if performed correctly, will provide a unique stimulus for improving hip and knee explosiveness, which will translate to more strength and more muscle. And in my opinion, it can absolutely be learned without a coach.
23:38:19 #toronto <nupogodi> "attention" notwithstanding, i'm just sharing my shit in the way that i usually share my shit

00:09:02 #logcabin <natefalls> you can't flex cardio
00:09:08 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> agreed mr. Supple_Leopard 
00:09:12 #logcabin <bbf> when i said i have a terrible body you said i had a busted brain
00:09:17 #logcabin <wils> if you want to not be winded by typing out a a long forums post, cardio might be a good idea.  but not running unless you specifically want to run
00:09:21 #logcabin <bbf> are you saying i have a not-terrible body
00:09:24 #logcabin <bbf> secret compliment???
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
00:09:44 #logcabin <Kyashi> your body isnt terrible
00:09:50 #logcabin <wils> i am not kidding when i say that running only as a means to an end never stops being suffering and shit and bad
00:10:14 #logcabin <bbf> running makes my fat person knee hurt
00:10:21 #logcabin <Supple_Leopard> Maybe find a form of cardio you enjoy?
00:10:25 #logcabin <bbf> also thats the nicest thing kyashi has ever said to me
00:10:35 #logcabin <wils> running approached poorly makes everyone's knees hurt
00:10:39 #logcabin <wils> if you are heavy it is even worse, though, yeah
00:10:49 #logcabin <bbf> i enjoy steep incline walking on a treadmill
00:10:55 #logcabin <Supple_Leopard> yeah running breaks my knees 
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
00:11:07 #logcabin <wils> yeah that is a cool option that i did for a while last cut/diet
00:11:10 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> for some reason my knees have never had an issue w/ running

01:28:40 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> how did you set it off Susical 
01:28:52 #toronto <teethgrinder> that shouldn't matter
01:29:03 #logcabin <wils> she walked in the door
01:29:05 #logcabin <Susical> i took a 45 off the bar and didn't gently put it back down
01:29:08 #logcabin <Susical> just kinda
01:29:09 #logcabin <Susical> put it down
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
01:29:10 #logcabin <wils> and heard
01:29:11 #toronto <nupogodi> teethgrinder i don't care if he's cool, no one cares if i'm cool, he straight up talked shit and i called him out on it. that's that
01:29:13 #logcabin <wils> AWWWOOOOOGA
01:29:13 #logcabin <Boogan> haha
01:29:18 #toronto <teethgrinder> nupogodi, I've had other encounters with him, through cycling, and I've had no reason to believe he's a liar
01:29:25 #logcabin <Susical> i was like
01:29:28 #toronto <nupogodi> well okay but in this instance he lied
01:29:28 #toronto <nupogodi> so
01:29:29 #logcabin <Susical> THAT WASN'T FOR ME WAS IT???????????
01:29:29 #logcabin <Pointsman> lol
01:29:37 #toronto <nupogodi> either that or he is gravely mistaken
01:29:41 #logcabin <wils> wonder if they have vibration detection too
01:29:46 #toronto <teethgrinder> that is a distinct possibility
01:29:47 #logcabin <wils> like all the high tech security shit
01:29:53 #toronto <teethgrinder> I just think you're being quick to judge
01:29:59 #logcabin <Susical> it was like IMMEDIATELY after
01:30:02 #toronto <nupogodi> when in rome...
01:30:02 #logcabin <Boogan> spends tens of thousands on lunk alarm system
01:30:05 #logcabin <Boogan> only has 1 squat rack
01:30:19 #logcabin <Susical> it had 0 squat racks
01:30:20 #logcabin <wils> well it does not sound as though they want you to use it
01:30:21 #logcabin <Susical> and 6 smith machines
01:30:21 #toronto <teethgrinder> Even if he has a good reason, unfortunately I don't think he'll bother defending himself in the thread
01:30:24 #logcabin <Boogan> only has 0 squat rack
01:30:27 #toronto <teethgrinder> he's pretty passive

01:30:50 #logcabin <wils> most successful gym's business model is to discourage exercise
01:30:52 #toronto <DrN> nupogodi, it isn't about wither you are right or wrong, it is about how you responded. It was really immature, 
01:30:54 #toronto <nupogodi> not just me,

01:36:15 #logcabin <passthebutter> I use a single 45 bumper per side, but when we didnt have them
01:36:18 #logcabin <swolehalla> because of the sound it makes every rep?  some dude on a smith machine was calling me out for making noise (not at planet fitness)
01:36:18 #toronto <nupogodi> that's how it was before, that's how it's going to be now, at least for me.

01:37:38 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> Probably
01:37:47 #toronto <teethgrinder> he's accusing lonely abject turd of being a liar for his story about getting ticketed based on his 407 entry and exit times
01:37:53 #logcabin <Pointsman> i once banana'd the 3rd shittiest bar in the gym (it remains the 3rd shittiest bar in the gym) bailing a front squat onto the rack
01:37:59 #logcabin <polygon> even dropping 5+ plate DLs isn't tht loud
01:38:00 #logcabin <Pointsman> and that is the loudest thing i have ever heard in the gym
01:38:11 #logcabin <Pointsman> i've squatted with that bar since
01:38:11 #logcabin <Boogan> idk
01:38:17 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> oh
01:38:19 #logcabin <wils> that's just breaking it in

01:38:22 #logcabin <Pointsman> and now i get horrible flashbacks whenever i see someone front squatting with rails
01:38:23 #logcabin <Boogan> its p loud

01:38:26 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> thats like a maelstrom of things I don't care about
01:38:31 #toronto <teethgrinder> yeah
01:38:36 #toronto <nupogodi> yes because when the 407 was becoming a thing that was a BIG DEAL that people were worried about, and tons of shit went around and basically it's super illegal and there's no way he's telling the truth about that
01:38:37 #toronto <nupogodi> so he lied
01:38:42 #toronto <nupogodi> but hes like "nah bros it happened"
01:38:44 #toronto <nupogodi> so fuck that
01:38:49 #logcabin <polygon> i front squat with rails but my max front squat is 170 
01:38:56 #logcabin <polygon> if a goon fails a <200 squat does it make a sound
01:38:59 #toronto <nupogodi> i dont care about decorum (obviously)
01:39:03 #logcabin <Pointsman> yes, totally will
01:39:10 #logcabin <polygon> i know i have done it lol rip
01:39:15 #logcabin <Pointsman> i think it was my 295 that did it
01:39:20 #toronto <nupogodi> i know when i'm wrong, and when i'm being a dick... sometimes i still go ahead with it
01:39:22 #logcabin <Pointsman> much weaker at the time
01:39:25 #toronto <nupogodi> but this is not one of those cases.
01:39:26 #logcabin <Pointsman> i don't think i have the video anymore

01:39:31 #logcabin <Pointsman> but you can see the bar
01:39:31 #logcabin <polygon> it wasn't that loud tho, then again my fails are more slow sad slumps into defeat

02:33:44 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> ratemygoon.com
02:33:47 #toronto <Typh> Typh: 8/10
02:33:48 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> GOOD
02:33:50 #logcabin <wils> even markham
02:33:51 #toronto <Tighclops> do it
02:33:57 #toronto <teethgrinder> but I'm now questioning whether I would actually bike there regularly
02:34:14 #toronto <teethgrinder> and this isn't me being avoidant
02:34:22 #toronto <teethgrinder> I'm fully prepared to go SOMEWHERE this weekend
02:34:28 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> I was out the other night and one of the female trainers noticed me and was like... "Do you work out at Fortis? With the red chucks right?"
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
02:34:35 #toronto <teethgrinder> hahahaha
02:34:35 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> thank god
02:34:39 #toronto <teethgrinder> I don't have that problem
02:34:57 #toronto <teethgrinder> my foolish fiancee for some reason loves me regardless of the shit I've pulled
02:35:11 #toronto <Typh> Typh: 9/10
02:35:12 #toronto <teethgrinder> (mostly while sleepwalking)
02:35:34 #toronto <teethgrinder> a major contribution to me quitting "drinking"
02:35:47 #toronto <loangote> why is that word in quotes
02:35:54 #toronto <teethgrinder> scale
02:35:58 #toronto <teethgrinder> I still drink
02:35:58 #toronto <Typh> he drinks pee
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
02:36:04 #toronto <teethgrinder> but I stop after 2-3
02:36:09 #toronto <Typh> 2-3 pees
02:36:18 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> lol
02:36:20 #toronto <teethgrinder> and there was one incident where I'd drunk extremely heavily
02:36:37 #toronto <teethgrinder> and she had to talk sleepwalking-me out of peeing into her laundry hamper
02:36:43 #toronto <MoistVonLipwig> lol
02:36:47 #toronto <teethgrinder> rather humiliating
02:36:51 #toronto <teethgrinder> but she's a good sport
02:36:52 #toronto <Tighclops> I am a lightweight now, I used to be able to get fucking cruuuunk and still homing pidgeon home
02:36:57 #toronto <teethgrinder> and I mention it as a cautionary tail
02:37:05 #toronto <teethgrinder> tale
02:37:26 #toronto <teethgrinder> Tighclops, I'd done that for 15 years
02:37:38 #toronto <teethgrinder> but at my ripe old age of 32 ... it's apparently become problematic
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
02:37:48 #toronto <Tighclops> I'm 27 :            /
02:38:03 #toronto <teethgrinder> again, I don't mean this as a universal
02:38:05 #toronto <teethgrinder> just cautionary
02:38:07 #toronto <teethgrinder> that it's possible
02:38:12 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> Cheese, and Rat juice. Be a snake and a snitch eod, and ure gtg. Be be discreet about being a rat. I was a rat and got banned. 
02:38:15 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> I'm a fake. Never touched a weight in my life.
02:38:17 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> How did I get so many posts? Because if you check my post history you will see 90% of the time al I said was "I agree!"...""x2!!!!"...."he's right!!". I don't know shit. I pretend I do. But got caught.
02:38:30 #toronto <Tighclops> I just need to stop beer, it's some combo of the carbonation and hops
02:38:34 #toronto <teethgrinder> It's unlikely that I've ever sleepwalked prior
02:38:41 #toronto <Tighclops> I have like 2 beers now and I feel queasy :(
02:38:46 #toronto <teethgrinder> but it started happening on rough nights
02:38:59 #toronto <Tighclops> that is indeed problematic

02:58:48 #toronto <teethgrinder> My parents are Estonian
02:58:58 #toronto <Butcher> Tighclops yessss
02:58:59 #toronto <tehloki> The ussr was communist below a certain financial caste

02:59:28 #toronto <teethgrinder> my problem with "communism" is that it seems based in something that isn't remotely realistic
02:59:31 #toronto <Tighclops> the ussr was communist the same way north korea is a democratic people's republic 
02:59:51 quit -!- DrN has quit [Client exited]
03:00:03 #toronto <teethgrinder> but I agree that our form of "capitalism", very deliberate quotes, is classist in retarded ways
03:00:11 #toronto <Tighclops> I think the only way to achieve anything resembling communism is to fuck off to a modestly sized torus in space with a few hundred like minded folks
03:00:18 #toronto <teethgrinder> like we don't have true capitalism
03:00:26 #toronto <teethgrinder> I'm not sure it's the best idea
03:00:30 #toronto <Tighclops> because if you try to do it here some capitalist will kick over your anthill
03:00:30 #toronto <teethgrinder> but what we have is shit
03:00:33 #toronto <DrunkCanuck> yes we do
03:00:37 #toronto <DrunkCanuck> this is true capitalism
03:00:42 #toronto <tehloki> Not really

03:01:00 #toronto <DrunkCanuck> ehehe
03:01:05 #toronto <teethgrinder> you know what I mean
03:01:06 #toronto <Tighclops> the truth of capitalism is that to varying degree, it sucks if you're not lucky enough to be born with capital
03:01:06 #toronto <tehloki> Anything that restricts people's ability to buy products and services from each other inhibits capitalism
03:01:08 #toronto <teethgrinder> "in theory"

03:17:04 #toronto <Tighclops> actually there are parties downtown where I could probably do that I should try to go this weekend
03:17:14 #toronto <teethgrinder> I think it would be picking the female Mass Effect 2/3 avatar
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
03:17:51 #toronto <Tighclops> I never ever played those games but whoever plays femshep's voice literally makes me weak in the knees
03:17:57 #toronto <Tighclops> I hope I never find out what she actually looks like
03:18:08 #toronto <teethgrinder> haha
03:18:10 #toronto <teethgrinder> no idea
03:18:32 #toronto <teethgrinder> I like playing female characters in games generally ... because I like female butts
03:18:40 #toronto <Tighclops> yeah girlbutts are the best
03:18:47 #toronto <teethgrinder> but in Mass Effect 2 it was suddenly too real
03:18:50 #toronto <loangote> i developed a huge crush on my saints row 3 character :|

03:19:42 #toronto <teethgrinder> never played a Halo game heh
03:20:10 #logcabin <Seluin> New battery bought. Tomorrow I'm buying wire cutters/strippers to replace the terminals
03:20:11 #toronto <Tighclops> I used to love them, halo 4 pretty much killed it for everybody and now I don't play games

04:26:54 #logcabin <bbf> but i got weird black teeth
04:26:54 #logcabin <carboncopy> so you may not want to switch them out if you can't actually see them
04:26:56 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> But they're better than amalgam
04:27:11 #logcabin <carboncopy> there are actually different shades of the white filling
04:27:16 #whitelodge <passthebutter> failures?
04:27:16 #logcabin <carboncopy> we can match them to your teeth shade
04:27:23 #whitelodge <passthebutter> but you did it, that sounds not like failures
04:27:24 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> That requires a cosmetic dentist or someone who gives a shit
04:27:27 #logcabin <carboncopy> there are at least 12 different shades that are commonly on the market

04:27:34 #logcabin <bbf> i mean like the fillings are super dark it sucks
04:27:35 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> General "You need a filling" is getting what is on hand
04:27:36 #logcabin <carboncopy> it takes like a minute to match the shade
04:27:36 #logcabin <bbf> damn parents
04:27:47 #logcabin <carboncopy> honestly in a molar or something i wouldn't match the shade
04:27:52 #logcabin <carboncopy> because no one will see it

04:36:11 #whitelodge <Pointsman> to be fair, from an anatomical standpoint, it's pretty hard to entirely separate the actions of the rear delts from the back

04:36:20 #whitelodge <passthebutter> true
04:36:40 #whitelodge <helloclarice> those one arm lat pulldowns are awesome
04:36:43 #whitelodge <passthebutter> Ive been improving on my cable rear delt work, but I can see improvement in the rear delts and then all across the back
04:36:47 #whitelodge <passthebutter> in the same line
04:36:50 #whitelodge <passthebutter> so idk
04:37:00 #whitelodge <passthebutter> lift a bunch of shit and good things will happen however

04:38:00 #whitelodge <Pointsman> including rows of any sort
04:38:06 #whitelodge <passthebutter> I would agree that those 2 lifts do a lot

11:17:44 #logcabin <dv> hey buddy, how are you
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:18:48 #logcabin <Helios> pretty good, tho the car is at the mechanic and i hope it won't cost too much to fix it
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:20:04 #logcabin <dv> what's the matter with it?
11:21:08 #logcabin <Helios> front left wheel feels wobbly at higher speeds also noticeable when breaking, just suddenly happened while driving
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:21:43 #logcabin <Helios> and I don't want to lose it while traveling at 80mph
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:23:01 #logcabin <dv> haha, no
11:23:20 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> whens the last time you did the brakes
11:23:23 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> and alignment
11:23:32 #logcabin <dv> not much of a far guy but i hope it's nothing too pricey Helios 
11:23:58 #logcabin <dv> far=car
11:24:14 #logcabin <Helios> alignment was like 1.5months ago when i needed to change from winter to summer tires
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
11:24:25 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> its always like...alignment, brakes/rotors fucked up, ball joints or a wonky tire/bent rim for the old wobbly wobble
11:24:29 #logcabin <Helios> i don't know if they checked the breaks
11:24:34 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> or maybe something awesome and just the lug nuts are loose

11:26:19 #logcabin <dv> yeah i've had it be lug nuts before, but it's also been brake/rotor or bearing problems
11:26:42 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> ah your headlight fluid is low
11:26:51 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> also the hydrostatic compression fittings on the thermocoupling need a good shimmy

13:11:19 #toronto <teethgrindr> unfortunately I can't take stairs to my place
13:11:22 #toronto <teethgrindr> it's really annoying
13:11:29 #toronto <teethgrindr> they just don't open to the ground floor
13:11:36 #logcabin <Seluin> good morning, my lovelies
13:11:41 #whitelodge <Seluin> hello LifeSpan-Void
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:11:48 #whitelodge <Seluin> this morning I blazed through 150 seconds of your snaps
13:11:50 #whitelodge <Seluin> and it was glorious
13:12:00 #toronto <teethgrindr> they have a set of one-way doors that open to the street
13:13:03 #toronto <Butcher> have u tried complaining?
13:13:03 #toronto <teethgrindr> at my last place I used to regularly take the stairs to my 19th floor apartment
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:13:18 #toronto <teethgrindr> the building is physically designed to not work that way
13:13:36 #toronto <teethgrindr> there's literally nothing they could do, even with renovating, the city probably wouldn't permit it
13:13:43 #toronto <Butcher> then i guess u gotta move buddy
13:13:46 #toronto <teethgrindr> they weirdly need permits just to build a new bike room
13:13:56 #toronto <teethgrindr> ... or I can take the elevator two stories up every day instead
13:14:03 #toronto <slushey> http://www.thestar.com/business/2014/07/24/kfc_to_offer_beer_at_two_toronto_locations.html
13:14:12 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> ahaha
13:14:24 #toronto <teethgrindr> that's not going to affect my biannual kfc habit
13:14:26 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> no screenshots though
13:14:32 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> nothing worth keeping
13:14:32 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> gm Seluin 
13:14:34 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> gm goons
13:14:39 #toronto <teethgrindr> that said I think it's been more than two years since I've been there, and I'm still not feeling it
13:14:42 #toronto <slushey> i can't remember the last time i had kfc
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:15:14 #toronto <Butcher> i occasionally like kfc but popeye's chicken owns
13:15:33 #toronto <Butcher> i would take popeyes over kfc 9 times out of 10
13:16:13 #whitelodge <Seluin> I don't take screenshots. I feel it violates the trust of snapchat
13:16:20 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> ah
13:16:23 #toronto <teethgrindr> never had popeye's but my boss was raving about it recently
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:16:24 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> i give conesnt
13:16:29 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> consent

13:16:43 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> lookin pretty thick lsv 
13:17:06 #toronto <Butcher> it's good don't get poutine there tho it's shit
13:17:08 #whitelodge <Seluin> haha
13:17:11 #whitelodge <Seluin> so noted!
13:17:28 #toronto <Butcher> i was raving about popeyes and took two friends and popeyes uses these spicy fries
13:17:38 #toronto <Butcher> they both got th epoutine and it was disgusting
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:18:16 #toronto <Butcher> their spicy fries are fine, but with gravy and cheese curds it just didn't go together
13:18:52 #whitelodge <Susical> ya he screenshots everything of mine
13:18:55 #whitelodge <Susical> so it would only be fair

13:22:51 #toronto <atv> oh are we talking about gross fast food fried chicken? :V
13:22:52 #toronto <Butcher> poutine is delicious but definitely should be enjoyed occasionally at most
13:22:59 #toronto <slushey> its popular out east, only one in the area is dufferin and lawrence
13:23:11 #toronto <atv> (go to stockyards eat their fried chicken)
13:23:47 #toronto <slushey> also might i suggest mary browns tater poutine

18:53:58 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> hah
18:53:59 #logcabin <polygon> womens lifting thread: periods, humble bragging about mediocre lifts, obesity, implying big butts bc no pants fit when u don't even lift, self hatred and blatant body image issues
18:54:03 #logcabin <Linguica> lmao i just saw http://i.imgur.com/7Y7kXr7.gif
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:54:52 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> post that polygon
18:55:05 #logcabin <helloclarice> So we're not allowed to post about the emotional issues we have with lifting or body image?
18:55:15 #logcabin <polygon> no HC that's not what i mean
18:55:21 #logcabin <helloclarice> Only people who deadlift a certain amount can post?
18:55:35 #logcabin <polygon> look at clownbabby's post for example, it actually relates to lifting
18:55:44 #logcabin <polygon> and psychological aspects of lifting
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:56:00 #logcabin <polygon> that is important and should be considered imo but like, it's a LIFTING thread not a general weight loss thread and a lot of people treat it as such
18:56:10 #logcabin <helloclarice> Yes that is a great post 
18:56:22 #logcabin <polygon> also, everyone can post regardless of how much they lift, but there are a lot of people who throw up numbers just to brag online and it's real dumb
18:56:34 #logcabin <polygon> it's v obvious, if your question has nothing to do with the weight lifted
18:56:41 #logcabin <BurritoKing> only ever post about your burritos
18:56:57 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> there is a weight loss challenge thread that a lot of ppl post about WL stuff and psychology in
18:57:03 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> maybe redirect those posts over there
18:57:06 #logcabin <polygon> ex: i have been stalled at this bench weight for a long time, what to do? # is important. or: i am thinking of doing intermediate programming, is that a good choice? also a great time to state ur max lifts
18:57:24 #logcabin <helloclarice> But it's a dialogue not just Done Solved because some people are more emotionally/mentally secure than others
18:57:26 #logcabin <wils> i preface with
18:57:30 #logcabin <polygon> but there are some ppl who repeatedly post their lift numbers and spam em all over in threads tha have nothing to do with that
18:57:30 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> though it is also the most disconnected from the rest of TFLC - I see a lot of advice getting thrown around in there that is against central dogma
18:57:31 #logcabin <wils> as someone who squats more than they weigh,
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:57:36 #logcabin <wils> even in work emails
18:57:44 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> i don't venture in that thread often, but it seems  a lot of the goals are aesthetic and yet people still do SS
18:58:24 #logcabin <polygon> everyone does goon "stripped 5x5" or SS or SL p much
18:58:49 #logcabin <BigassMoth69> its sexist that there's a bra thread but no jockstrap thread
18:58:52 #logcabin <BigassMoth69> XXXXS for me
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:59:04 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> I dunno how hard is it to get fitted for a strap
18:59:07 #logcabin <polygon> that's a given
18:59:12 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> my strap and cup fit gr8 first time
18:59:18 #logcabin <Kyashi> lol jockstrap thread
18:59:20 #logcabin <Kyashi> make one
18:59:21 #logcabin <helloclarice> Well that's usually where beginners are directed polygon
18:59:24 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> I even like the colour
18:59:29 #logcabin <helloclarice> to do 5x5 or SS 
18:59:36 #logcabin <wils> is that wrong
18:59:38 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> yeah then we can post pics of our jock straps
18:59:45 #logcabin <wils> or rather, bad advice
18:59:45 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> on our bodies and ask if they look like they fit

19:00:00 #logcabin <polygon> yeah i know i am just replying to RB re: people doing SS 
19:00:12 #logcabin <polygon> tbf if you are a total noob you'll probably be fine doing whatever
19:00:15 #logcabin <passthebutt> Ive never done starting strength
19:00:18 #logcabin <Kyashi> me either
19:00:25 #logcabin <passthebutt> clearly we have fucked it all up
19:00:26 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> me either
19:00:27 #logcabin <wils> does that mean people should not do it
19:00:28 #logcabin <Kyashi> look at me now, body in shambles
19:00:30 #logcabin <polygon> i started with some janky half BBing program at first and got up to like 175 squat before i needed to do anything else

19:00:35 #logcabin <polygon> just by like, showing up and lifting 3-4x a week

19:00:49 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> aw yeah
19:00:49 #logcabin <Kyashi> i probably did more squatting than SS
19:00:54 #logcabin <Kyashi> ty oly
19:00:55 #logcabin <polygon> i did less squatting
19:01:00 #logcabin <helloclarice> That's good. I was on SS for a long time and I never got above 135 squat so
19:01:01 #logcabin <polygon> than ss

20:13:21 #yossec <Neu> well
20:13:21 #toronto <atv> that ended differently than i expected
20:13:22 #yossec <Neu> not difficult
20:13:22 #toronto <atv> haha
20:13:25 #yossec <Neu> just not as easy as you'd think
20:13:27 #yossec <sharktopus> well start with the 2 brick problem
20:13:29 #yossec <afreak> like i keep thinking it's ((4x2)^2)^6
20:13:33 #yossec <sharktopus> oh no
20:13:35 #yossec <sharktopus> much more than that
20:13:43 #yossec <sharktopus> i mean the expression is more complicated
20:13:44 #yossec <sharktopus> its like
20:13:47 #yossec <Neu> at least thats what stack exchange says
20:13:48 #yossec <sharktopus> take 2 2x4 bricks
20:13:53 #yossec <Neu> err stackoverflow
20:13:55 #yossec <sharktopus> assume overlap of 1
20:14:00 #yossec <sharktopus> assume both in same orientation
20:14:06 #toronto <teethgrindr> ?
20:14:07 #logcabin <BigassMoth69> damn looks like i made things a little too real in here
20:14:12 #yossec <sharktopus> you have 7 positions on one size
20:14:16 #yossec <sharktopus> with diff orientations
20:14:22 #logcabin <Kyashi> im trying to think of a good shitpost

20:14:52 #yossec <Neu> oh fuck
20:14:54 #yossec <afreak> lol
20:14:54 #logcabin <BigassMoth69> just copy one of mine, i have thousands
20:14:55 #yossec <Neu> shit
20:14:57 #yossec <Neu> my mouse freaked out and i copied this chat, lol
20:15:00 #yossec <Neu> Let x1,x2,...xk be a solution such that x1 copies of combination 1, x2 copies of combination 2 ....
20:15:03 #yossec <Neu> F([]) = F([x1=0]+F([x1=1]...

20:15:34 #yossec <afreak> and the odd ways it could be connected that way
20:15:34 #yossec <sharktopus> well
20:15:38 #yossec <afreak> oh god this is turning into a mess
20:15:43 #yossec <sharktopus> 2x4 bricks wont fit into the 3 big holes
20:15:45 #yossec <Neu> yeah this isnt simple
20:15:46 #yossec <sharktopus> because they wont snug up
20:15:46 #yossec <afreak> true
20:15:51 #yossec <sharktopus> in any orientation
20:15:58 #yossec <afreak> so let's assume always snug
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
20:16:23 #yossec <sharktopus> the full overlap opposite orientation case is a bit more involved
20:16:36 #yossec <sharktopus> writing a program for this would suck shit
20:16:41 #yossec <sharktopus> the way im conceptualizing it
20:16:47 #logcabin <Panthra1> I think there is a female powerlifter with me at del taco 
20:16:55 #yossec <Neu> http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=71971
20:16:58 #yossec <Neu> there we go
20:16:58 #logcabin <Panthra1> She ordered a Fiesta pack and is eating it alone 
20:16:58 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> how do you figure
20:17:00 #logcabin <Kyashi> how are the quads looking
20:17:01 #logcabin <Kyashi> lol
20:17:13 #logcabin <Panthra1> A Fiesta pack is a box full of like 12 tacos and burritos
20:17:25 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> sounds reasonable
20:17:33 #logcabin <Kyashi> the tacos are tiny tho
20:17:33 #yossec <sharktopus> Do you think it's fair that we only count the number of combinations where all bricks are at perfect 90 degree angles? The round studs of LEGO bricks allow us to turn the bricks at any angle and using these bricks we can make many other interesting configurations than those found using these computer programs. Think for instance of the six bricks forming a hexagon.
20:17:34 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> says the guy who ate a giant donut
20:17:38 #yossec <sharktopus> oh ya i didnt even think about that
20:17:39 #yossec <sharktopus> i was only doing 90deg
20:17:43 #logcabin <jkim> jsut b/c someone is fat doesnt mean theyre a powerlifter..
20:17:43 #yossec <Neu> yeah
20:17:44 #yossec <sharktopus> but you could pivot on the edge
20:17:45 #yossec <Neu> basically it's infinite
20:17:49 #logcabin <Kyashi> i probably cant eat 12 of them tho
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
20:17:55 #yossec <sharktopus> yeah 2 bricks infinite there because it's continuous
20:18:01 #yossec <Neu> or at least really high
20:18:04 #yossec <sharktopus> functionally infinite
20:18:04 #logcabin <Panthra1> She also looks strong jkim
20:18:05 #yossec <sharktopus> ya
20:18:07 #yossec <afreak> this is hurting my head

22:54:33 #logcabin <pr0zac> these must taste horrible
22:54:38 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> wait, it's really protein?
22:54:41 #logcabin <pr0zac> i can't imagine they figured out how to make them taste good
22:54:47 #logcabin <pr0zac> 21g of protein in a bag
22:54:52 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> holy shit
22:54:56 #logcabin <pr0zac> yeah exactly
22:55:02 #logcabin <wils> and it's not even ghetto soy
22:55:02 #logcabin <passthebutt> I would eat that
22:55:05 #logcabin <passthebutt> love me some bbq chips
22:55:06 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> how expensive is it though? :(
22:55:12 #logcabin <pr0zac> god dammit i need to order these
22:55:12 #logcabin <wils> probably expensive
22:55:14 #logcabin <passthebutt> quest is legit, I would trust them
22:55:18 #logcabin <wils> they're not out yet i think
22:55:18 #logcabin <passthebutt> to make me fat and broke
22:55:22 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> well yeah quest bars and all that
22:55:23 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> where's my raise, I've oppressed MULTIPLE women this week
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
22:55:37 #logcabin <pr0zac>  $2.39  a bag
22:55:41 #logcabin <pr0zac> so yeah p expensive

22:55:47 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> aw
22:55:53 #logcabin <wils> if they did it
22:55:55 #logcabin <wils> i can do it
22:55:57 #whitelodge <passthebutt> now you get 5$ a month and a kick
22:56:05 #whitelodge <passthebutt> ask me for another
22:56:10 #logcabin <wils> is the protein like, sprinkled on?  part of the coating?
22:56:20 #logcabin <wils> or are the potatoes reconstituted slurry
22:56:23 #logcabin <wils> with the protein added
22:56:23 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> i love their breakdown of other foods relative to the chips
22:56:33 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> steak has more fat than protein per serving
22:56:36 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> aww yeah
22:56:42 #logcabin <polygon> given that protein is the first ingredient i'm guessing potato slurry
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
22:57:03 #logcabin <wils> well we know how much of each is contained, since it's 21g protein, 5g carb
22:57:03 #logcabin <polygon> a coating of that much protein would be really groce
22:57:14 #logcabin <wils> i would think so too but maybe they use a strong flavour system to mask it?
22:57:22 #logcabin <passthebutt> Iput 2 scoops whey in my oatmeal and called in breakfast
22:57:24 #logcabin <wils> says dried potatoes..
22:57:26 #logcabin <passthebutt> it didnt come out super good
22:57:33 #logcabin <pr0zac> yeah im really confused how they figured out how to make that taste good
22:57:36 #logcabin <polygon> i just drink protein shakes with my food if the food i have does not have enough protein
22:57:54 #logcabin <passthebutt> my post wo and lunch was a chik breast with some rice n brocolli
22:57:55 #logcabin <wils> passthebutt: it can be done but you may have to fiddle
22:57:59 #logcabin <passthebutt> have steak for dinner
22:58:02 #logcabin <polygon> guess i've been missing out on marinating my veggies in protein powder
22:58:02 #logcabin <Kyashi-phone> Yeah 
22:58:11 #logcabin <passthebutt> wils yeah, needed to add some stevia to it
22:58:20 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> i've been eating more sandwiches for lunch now that i found a place that makes fresh heroes for only like $8ish bucks
22:58:29 #logcabin <Kyashi-phone> I tried it the wils or pointsman way and it was edible 
22:58:30 #logcabin <wils> i seem to think i did 4:2:1 ratio of water, oat bran, protein powder.. could be wrong.  used musclepharm cookies n creme and it was agreeable

22:58:43 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> good working lunch
22:58:46 #logcabin <passthebutt> I added whey after cooking the oatmeal
22:58:53 #logcabin <wils> still, these chips could be good as a stash
22:59:00 #logcabin <passthebutt> Fhqwhgads Im doing lowish fat, medium carb levels
22:59:02 #logcabin <wils> for when you want chips rather than beep boop macros
22:59:08 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> PLEASE SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER
22:59:14 #logcabin <passthebutt> yeah those chips look good for sure
22:59:19 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> i'm honestly not counting but i know i need to do more protein less crap
22:59:21 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> :p

23:02:35 #logcabin <Linguica> wow thats kind of weird
23:02:38 #logcabin <wils> 200g protein is only 800 cal, so there is plenty of room for carbs in almost any diet
23:02:47 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> and the protein/carb ratio has to be better. all the chipotle burritos i've ever seen is like 99% carbs

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
23:03:11 #logcabin <polygon> i only go to chipotle if i'm on the road and even the no meat no cheese burrito i have gotten in the past is not that bad

23:03:30 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> also a burrito is $10

01:56:31 #logcabin <thongbutt> only noticed an hour after leaving
01:56:32 #whitelodge <hc-ipad> today I did shoulders and it was not quite the best day I've ever had
01:56:32 #whitelodge <WasianChickn> easier to gauge the quantitative

01:57:31 #whitelodge <hc-ipad> right wasianchickn

04:13:25 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> i mix cc with a thing of flavored yogurt
04:13:29 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> and flax seed
04:13:33 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> I did notice it's a little swollen though
04:13:35 #logcabin <wils> Seluin: not a bad description
04:13:37 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> just a little
04:13:40 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> like a bump
04:13:41 #logcabin <Pacra> its better imho to eat cottage cheese with a savory
04:13:42 #logcabin <wils> have you considered trying cellulite
04:13:44 #logcabin <Kyashi> cguy told me about the yogurt trick but i might as well buy greek yogurt then!!!
04:13:56 #logcabin <polygon> lol agreed....
04:13:57 #logcabin <Pacra> 100% greek yogurt is the best
04:13:59 #logcabin <Linguica> wait

04:14:52 #logcabin <wils> also good
04:15:01 #logcabin <wils> more versatile too
04:15:03 #logcabin <wils> than cc
04:15:03 #whitelodge <Kyashi> fine
04:15:05 #logcabin <wils> cc is cheaper though
04:15:12 #logcabin <WasianChickn> are you still addicted to cc
04:15:20 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> i love greek yogurt but it's $$$$
04:15:29 #logcabin <Russkiy_Bear> compared to cc

04:15:35 #logcabin <Seluin_> True
04:15:37 #logcabin <wils> not addicted, no, but it's my easiest protein staple from the supermarket next to work
04:15:38 #logcabin <carboncopy> greek yogurt is like $1/cup, is cc that much cheaper?
04:15:39 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> because of wils i have cc in my fridge
04:15:44 #logcabin <wils> if i do a costco run i buy greek yogurt instead

05:29:14 #yossec <afreak> S_N: with enough bandwidth and time, you could determine where someone is via tor
05:29:30 #yossec <afreak> the solution is what iz suggested
05:29:34 #yossec <afreak> leaving tor makes you detectable
05:29:34 #yossec <S_N> i wasnt here
05:29:44 #yossec <afreak> 21:57:58 <&iz> well, there's i2p also, but it's honestly not big enough
05:29:44 #yossec <afreak> 21:58:12 <&iz> i think it just comes down to using tor properly and carefully
05:29:44 #yossec <afreak> 21:59:11 <&iz> the real problem with tor, is that it's a proxy that goes to a normal web browser
05:29:47 #yossec <afreak> 21:59:17 <&iz> its
05:29:57 #yossec <S_N> its not a normal webbrowser
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
05:30:01 #yossec <S_N> its pretty heavily patched
05:30:06 #yossec <S_N> at least if you use tor browser bundle
05:30:08 #yossec <afreak> not torbrowser
05:30:17 #logcabin <hc-ipad> lol
05:30:22 #logcabin <Pacra> anything onion touches is gold
05:30:25 #logcabin <Pacra> its a national treasure
05:30:51 #logcabin <hc-ipad> the last hour of the night we have to send these computer alerts at 10:30, 10:45, and 11
05:30:53 #yossec <S_N> the problem you brought up is inherent to all low latency mixnet type designs though
05:31:04 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and my coworker just asked "Hey did you send that desk alert"
05:31:07 #yossec <S_N> if you want traffic to arrive "quickly" (whatever that means)
05:31:11 #yossec <S_N> its always going to be a problem
05:31:26 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and I just looked at him and said "Jerry, I am a Library and Information Sciences Professional"
05:31:26 #yossec <S_N> tor does a lot to mitigate it though
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
05:31:40 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and for some reason we both just laughed for like 5 min
05:31:45 #yossec <S_N> everything that has been talked about is fairly impractical
05:31:50 #logcabin <hc-ipad> ~job futility~
05:32:01 #logcabin <Panthra> so profesh
05:32:18 #logcabin <passthebutter> whats the alert for
05:32:21 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I have an MLS so that I can send alerts telling people to get the hell out of the library
05:32:31 #logcabin <Panthra> i bet they're still surprised at 11
05:32:36 #logcabin <passthebutter> its like the lunk alarm
05:32:38 #logcabin <passthebutter> for the library
05:32:39 #yossec <S_N> one thing i might like to see is some kind of quantisized tor traffic
05:32:40 #yossec <S_N> like
05:32:44 #logcabin <passthebutter> QUIT REEDIN N GITOUT
05:32:47 #logcabin <hc-ipad> yes panthra, they are
05:32:54 #yossec <S_N> you send 10kbs or 20 kbs or 30 kbs constantly

05:33:01 #yossec <S_N> and so on
05:33:03 #logcabin <hc-ipad> 11pm when the lights go off is the time to start packing up and shutting down for them, apparently
05:33:07 #yossec <S_N> and your traffic is "bucketed out"
05:33:13 #yossec <S_N> so its always one of the fixed speeds
05:33:17 #logcabin <hc-ipad> "Oh you mean... now? Now I have to go? Ooohhh..."
05:33:17 #yossec <S_N> as much as possible
05:33:31 #yossec <S_N> that would fuck with traffic analysis severely
05:33:32 #logcabin <hc-ipad> one lady the other night just rode the elevators up & down
05:33:39 #logcabin <Panthra> lmfao
05:33:47 #yossec <afreak> the only real practical way to sniff out who a tor user is is to find a flaw in their respective clients
05:33:54 #logcabin <hc-ipad> then when she came out at like 11:15 she was like "oh I was confused... can I use your phone..."
05:33:55 #yossec <afreak> which is what the fbi used to sniff out some pedo circle
05:34:00 #yossec <S_N> which almost excusively relies on changing data/packet rates
05:34:10 #yossec <S_N> and then corolating that
05:34:17 #logcabin <Panthra> lolllllll
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
05:34:30 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and my coworker was like "You are actually trespassing right now and we will call the police to escort you out if you don't leave on your own right now" :)
05:34:41 #logcabin <passthebutter> well you know, if the place were more clearly labeled
05:34:51 #logcabin <passthebutter> she would be able to more easily locate the bestseller section
05:35:01 #logcabin <Helios> put big glowing arrows on the floor
05:36:00 #logcabin <hc-ipad> it was the same woman passthebutter
05:36:02 #yossec <S_N> yeah that definitely remains the primary threat though
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
05:36:04 #yossec <S_N> id agree
05:36:18 #yossec <S_N> you can stay pretty safe by disabling JS though
05:36:25 #yossec <afreak> pretty much
05:36:27 #yossec <S_N> which is what virtually all browser exploits rely on
05:36:32 #yossec <afreak> irc clients not so much
05:36:36 #yossec <afreak> you have to disable dcc on those
05:36:57 #yossec <S_N> yeah, another thing to watch out for is ctcp replies
05:37:12 #yossec <S_N> if you use a setup like tails though
05:37:16 #yossec <S_N> all traffic is forced through tor
05:37:17 #logcabin <passthebutter> haha no shit?
05:37:19 #logcabin <passthebutter> good gues
05:37:29 #yossec <S_N> so even if you get exploited, they cant discover your real IP easily
05:37:39 #yossec <S_N> that goes doubly if you use some kind of gateway box
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
05:37:47 #yossec <S_N> with zero services
05:37:58 #yossec <S_N> even if they get root on the tor machine
05:38:02 #yossec <S_N> it wont help them
05:38:05 #logcabin <Helios> ah mental illness, right guys?
05:38:34 #yossec <afreak> that guy who ran the botnet over tor and did an ama
05:38:36 #yossec <afreak> he had it right
05:38:47 #yossec <afreak> talking about it on reddit was not a good idea
05:38:49 #logcabin <sharks> lol
05:38:53 #yossec <afreak> but otherwise the design he went for works
05:39:02 #yossec <S_N> talking about anything is what almost always gets you busted

05:40:33 #logcabin <Helios> passthebutter: i'll say i meant both
05:40:34 #yossec <afreak> it would probably never be found

05:41:04 #yossec <S_N> is very solid imo
05:41:04 #yossec <afreak> yeah
05:41:08 #logcabin <hc-ipad> but srs our group of mentally ill users are usually the most polite
05:41:21 #yossec <S_N> nearly impossible to exploit your way out of
05:41:34 #yossec <afreak> as long as your bots never reveal who they are then you're probably safe
05:41:40 #yossec <afreak> like i'd never want to know the ips on my botnet
05:41:40 #logcabin <hc-ipad> lots of methheads tho
05:41:47 #yossec <S_N> especially if the tor box is locked down tighter than jesus's asshole
05:41:49 #yossec <afreak> i'd want them obscured from me because it would be pointless

05:42:07 #logcabin <hc-ipad> they're the ones always starting fights and trying to hide/live in the library
05:42:17 #yossec <afreak> that way if someone comes across the bots

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
07:43:46 #logcabin <WasianChickn> you impregnante the cow to make milk, but if you're not getting a dairy cow out of it, then it's not of much use because other cows are raised from diff breeds
07:43:58 #logcabin <WasianChickn> i think a typical cow gives milk for like 18 months
07:44:09 #logcabin <WasianChickn> so that means a new calf per cow every 18 months, they gotta go somewhere

13:00:06 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> this guy i worked with back in school, a really shitty PHP dev, he was put under me and i was supposed to "mentor" him. he was an absolutely terrible developer, and INCREDIBLY annoying - broke more things than he fixed, constantly pestered me
13:00:09 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> nice guy though
13:00:27 #toronto <Butcher> thx 4 the fat joke, slushey 
13:00:33 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> anyhow so he started a fitness app with some guy, managed to amass over 1.5mil users, and just yesterday got 2.3 million in funding
13:00:46 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> and, ironically, i'm doing PHP now. -_- and don't have 2.3 million
13:00:56 #toronto <slushey> nice
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:00:59 #toronto <slushey> i want $2.3 mil in funding
13:01:03 #toronto <Butcher> nupogodi_alt: jesus loves you this i know
13:01:17 #toronto <Butcher> just not enough to get you $2.3 mil funding haha
13:01:35 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> yeah well i didn't build an app
13:01:46 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> if you pitched his idea to me, i would have shat on it and said there's a ton of competition on that space
13:01:49 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> in that space
13:02:02 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> but they managed to differentiate themselved by making it focused on sharing photos 
13:02:06 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> of your fitness accomplishments 
13:02:15 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> anyhow those >1.5m people are 90% women
13:02:25 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> so they brand themselves as a "Safe and comfortable space" to share your fitness nonsense
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:02:38 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> and that's... you know, that's not bad. 
13:02:44 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> but if you pitched it to me, i would shit on it
13:02:47 #toronto <Butcher> pretty smart
13:03:42 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> i guess i'm just jealous. guy's younger than me, not any smarter, just more ambitious and less willing to shit on things
13:03:48 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> and where am I and where is he?
13:04:02 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> i'm glad people succeed but, you know, i want to build something big too.
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:04:09 #toronto <teethgrindr> told you your attitude sucks
13:04:26 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> probably

13:04:32 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> dad tells me i should have been a lawyer
13:04:35 #toronto <slushey> well if you want to build something big it's not that hard
13:04:42 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> slushey: ok so you do it
13:04:46 #toronto <slushey> if you want to own something that explodes it's hard
13:04:51 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> then hire me when you get your funding :P
13:05:00 #toronto <Butcher> slushey built this irc... on rock and roll
13:05:02 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> cause i dont have any ideas
13:05:07 #toronto <slushey> i have an idea

13:12:57 #logcabin <BurritoKing> smashtcrusht: don't waste money on rings
13:13:04 #logcabin <Susical> cortez: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU OF ALL PEOPLE?
13:13:06 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> a coworker of mine back in school was doing his Masters and he wanted to build a location-sharing service that used cryptography so that you could safely upload your location but only people with your key could decode it, and only if they're nearby
13:13:08 #logcabin <BurritoKing> if you're marrying someone who wants you to waste money you could spend on a house on metal
13:13:10 #logcabin <BurritoKing> you're marrying wrong
13:13:13 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> oh okay
13:13:13 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> a twist on the millionaires problem
13:13:17 #logcabin <cortez> yeah i’m not proud
13:13:19 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> lets find the 1 girl out of 2500
13:13:20 #logcabin <cortez> just never got around to it
13:13:24 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> that not only agrees to that
13:13:26 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> anyhow then Google came out with Latitude and he's just like "ok fuck that then"
13:13:30 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> but is also rational enough to beleive it
13:13:34 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> fucking Google 
13:13:39 #logcabin <BurritoKing> i never bought lila an engagement ring, fuck that
13:13:40 #logcabin <cortez> just buy your girl a ring shut up BurritoKing 
13:13:44 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> she fullow knows how stupid the entire fuckign process is
13:13:44 #logcabin <BurritoKing> what an irritational waste of money
13:13:49 #toronto <teethgrindr> I liked Latitude
13:13:50 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> but she still has overwhelming vagina infecting her brain
13:13:53 #logcabin <cortez> it is a waste of money
13:13:55 #logcabin <BurritoKing> oh she's got a ring, it's just large and fits around the neck
13:13:56 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> now Google doesn't even do Latitude and every app shares your location anyway, without any of the cryptography nonsense
13:13:58 #logcabin <cortez> but they love it
13:14:07 #logcabin <passthebutter> eh you know she would be happier with a reasonably priced patch kit
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:14:09 #logcabin <Susical> just buy her a cock ring
13:14:11 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> it was a good idea, it just couldn't run on a phone ... was too computationally expensive.
13:14:13 #logcabin <cortez> ^
13:14:15 #logcabin <cortez> for her cock
13:14:15 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i'm just wondering what do ig et out of it
13:14:17 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i dont get a gift
13:14:17 #logcabin <cortez> hurrrrrrrr
13:14:30 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> "trust a central server" ended up winning
13:14:31 #logcabin <cortez> you get a bunch of blowjobs for up to a month
13:14:32 #toronto <teethgrindr> ran fine on my blackberry
13:14:34 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i could use a nice milwaukee lithium hammer drill 
13:14:37 #logcabin <BurritoKing> buy her a fitbit
13:14:38 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> i don't mean Latitude
13:14:39 #logcabin <Susical> smashtcrusht: yeah i know the whole thing is dumb too but goddamn if i wouldn't love a nice ring
13:14:42 #toronto <teethgrindr> o
13:14:43 #logcabin <BurritoKing> tell her it's like a ring but makes sure she doesn't get so damn fat
13:14:43 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> ^ see
13:14:44 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> i mean my coworker's Masters research
13:14:49 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> even fi you know its fully a debeers scam bullshit
13:14:50 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> you still want it
13:14:51 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> its whatever
13:14:52 #logcabin <cortez> the ring is not really for the girl
13:14:56 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> applying the Millionaires Problem to location sharing
13:14:56 #logcabin <BurritoKing> Susical: no way, you girls got equality now
13:14:58 #logcabin <cortez> it’s for other women to hate the girl
13:14:59 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> hahah BurritoKing

15:15:02 #whitelodge <passthebutter> he doesnt like me much I dont think.
15:15:19 #whitelodge <LSV2> Since I've stopped looking fat fonty doesn't have much to get under my skin for
15:15:32 #whitelodge <passthebutter> fonty talks a lot of noise but cant back shit up
15:15:36 #whitelodge <LSV2> And I ignore his requests for specific poses
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
15:15:43 #whitelodge <passthebutter> I enjoyed his tales of being drugged that made no sense
15:15:48 #whitelodge <LSV2> Yeah
15:15:49 #whitelodge <dv> as should be done with almost all of his posts LSV2 
15:15:52 #whitelodge <passthebutter> whereas I can talk shit to lifey
15:15:55 #whitelodge <Seluin> fonty is very young
15:15:56 #whitelodge <passthebutter> and he gets all nervous
15:16:03 #whitelodge <LSV2> Lol
15:16:05 #toronto <DrN> I am taking care of my mother

15:16:14 #whitelodge <LSV2> I get nervous?

15:16:51 #whitelodge <MoistVonLipwig> fontoyn is young
15:16:51 #logcabin <Buzkashi> wow
15:16:53 #whitelodge <LSV2> Maybe a little from your shit talk
15:16:55 #whitelodge <MoistVonLipwig> whats passthebutter's excuse

15:17:29 #whitelodge <passthebutter> MoistVonLipwig after awhile the youth excuses just dont pan anymore
15:17:32 #whitelodge <passthebutter> and youre just retarded
15:17:38 #whitelodge * passthebutter points at self
15:17:58 #whitelodge <dv> consider that fontoyn's retorts to people are usually "u have a smal dick" or "fight me irl"
15:18:12 #whitelodge <LSV2> Yeah I'm pretty sure fonty has actually gone backwards as he's aged
15:18:19 #whitelodge <dv> ^
15:18:28 #whitelodge <passthebutter> fontoyn follows a lot of the playbook that good ol backpanther did
15:18:43 #whitelodge <LSV2> And wouldn't be surprised if he has an IRL brain problem we don't know the extent of
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
15:18:56 #whitelodge <LSV2> Like bipolar or ASPD 
15:19:01 #whitelodge <dv> his family situation is a little fucked up to my knowledge
15:19:02 #whitelodge <passthebutter> so itll be interesting to see what happens with him in some catastrophic fashion
15:19:14 #whitelodge <Kyashi> funny since he said some shit to me about how i need to see a doctor
15:19:19 #whitelodge <passthebutter> he lost his mom recently I think.  which I have sympathy for, thats kinda horrible
15:19:24 #whitelodge <LSV2> He said WHAT
15:19:31 #whitelodge <LSV2> FETCH MY MUSKET
15:19:33 #whitelodge <dv> oh really? i knew his mom's health wasn't good
15:19:38 #whitelodge <LSV2> FONTY WILL BURN
15:19:46 #whitelodge <passthebutter> but Im 99% sure his drug story was just him practicing his coverup tale for the ER staff
15:19:59 #whitelodge <LSV2> yeah that story was utter bull
15:20:01 #whitelodge <passthebutter> dv yeah I remember him saying he had to come back to the US to go to funeral
15:20:21 #whitelodge <dv> i must've already tuned him out at that point

15:20:31 #yossec <Westie> wait
15:20:39 #whitelodge <passthebutter> LSV2 my theories on it - either it was a complete fabrication, or, he had a bad trip, went to the ER, and had to make up some shit to avoid having police scrutiny on himself
15:20:44 #yossec <Westie> how can a filename be too long if it's under like, 255 characters nadim
15:20:50 #whitelodge <LSV2> Yeah
15:20:55 #yossec <Westie> unless you really fucking want 8.3 support
15:20:55 #whitelodge <passthebutter> but I doubt anyone there cared

15:21:09 #logcabin <asexual_linuxmancer> oh god why  http://i.imgur.com/369Xo6g.jpg
15:21:09 #whitelodge <LSV2> Was true
15:21:12 #yossec <a_bad_github_repo> i think he's making the filename shorter to hide a deeper issue

15:37:25 #logcabin <Kyashi> 20 year old tea why
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
15:37:34 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> because tea is like wine
15:37:47 #logcabin <Susical> in that it's shitty
15:37:51 #logcabin <Kyashi> like ive ever tasted a wine above $5
15:37:52 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i let all my snapples sit for years
15:37:59 #logcabin <BurritoKing> they ferment certain teas
15:38:08 #logcabin <BurritoKing> and age some oolongs

15:40:31 #logcabin <Clownbabby> Norse I dance to that song p regularly
15:40:35 #logcabin <BurritoKing> i'm sure the israelis are up to the challenge of butchering more children
15:40:35 #logcabin <Clownbabby> It's good
15:40:38 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> thats usually how i get shit done that they don't want to pay me for

15:40:55 #logcabin <Clownbabby> for anything ever
15:40:56 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> 2 times ive done that, built products they didn't wanna build on my own time
15:41:02 #logcabin <BurritoKing> yes, i mean something bad happened to them 70 years ago
15:41:03 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> then they give me a bonus and i save them a lot of money -_-
15:41:10 #logcabin <BurritoKing> so therefore if they have to kill a bunch of kids .. who can blame them?

15:41:35 #logcabin <Linguica> and he says her facebook feed is basically nonstop hatred against palestinians right now
15:41:36 #whitelodge <LSV2> I need to furiously masturbate first
15:42:06 #logcabin <BurritoKing> yeah it's pretty sad
15:42:13 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> but anyhow this new kindle is fucking sweet i love it

15:42:50 #whitelodge <LSV2> I already am
15:42:58 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> you guys should go over there and ask the isrealis to stop

15:43:07 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> or sign a petition maybe
15:43:07 #logcabin <asexual_linuxmancer> because no other countries will take them because that would be tantamount to accepting Irael's existence as a soverign state

15:44:42 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> the first generation
15:44:43 #logcabin <BurritoKing> it's not anti-semitism to hate what israel is doing
15:44:49 #toronto <atv> ah
15:44:50 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> it just crapped out on me a few days ago
15:44:50 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> just admit you all love hamas

16:33:25 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> addiction is all powerful
16:33:27 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> I say this, but the amount I've been drinking since I started working in the ER worries me
16:33:30 #logcabin <BurritoKing> where their brain should say "HEY GUESS WHAT, DON'T FUCKING DO HEROIN"

16:33:42 #logcabin <MoistVonLipwig> no their brain says HEY DO MORE HEROIN THIS OWNS
16:33:43 #logcabin <Seluin> BurritoKing, remarkably hard.
16:33:45 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> from what heroin people say is it feels like the most amazing thing ever
16:33:49 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> Gonna take a long break from the drink
16:33:51 #logcabin <Seluin> BurritoKing, I mean. Addiction is a bitch.
16:33:57 #logcabin <BurritoKing> Seluin: i just find it confusing, like, don't start doing things that you can get addicted to
16:33:57 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> and normal people would say shit that feels too good to do and i'll end up likek trainspotting
16:34:01 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I don't do heroin because I heard it's addictive
16:34:04 #logcabin <dv> yeah HentaiTentacleDemon stop now before it gets worse
16:34:06 #logcabin <Seluin> We're just animals with brain chemicals.
16:34:07 #logcabin <BurritoKing> so by not trying it I will never have that problem
16:34:09 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> People wouldnt do drug or get wrecked if it didnt feel amazing
16:34:19 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> Even meth and crack feel amazing

16:34:45 #logcabin <BurritoKing> why would you even do it once
16:34:50 #logcabin <Seluin> and then went, "WAIT, THIS IS HOW IT WORKS"

16:35:16 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I've done ecstasy
16:35:18 #logcabin <HentaiTentacleDemon> Meth is the same as ecstasy without the lovey dovey feeling
16:35:20 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i have never touched anything for the reasons we're stating
16:35:28 #logcabin <Clownbabby> cocaine is scary

16:35:36 #logcabin <Clownbabby> I even feel that with champagne
16:35:36 #hugcabin <Seluin> FUN
16:35:38 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i'd like to think i'm better than taht and would survive and be fine, but why risk it
16:35:40 #logcabin <BurritoKing> so they can spot the people who get easily addicted
16:35:44 #logcabin <Clownbabby> I can't even imagine me on cocaine
16:35:46 #logcabin <BurritoKing> and only sell drugs and booze to those who don't? Idk :/
16:35:47 #logcabin <Clownbabby> I'd be lost 
16:35:50 #logcabin <Seluin> BurritoKing, hell. Think about gambling.
16:35:54 #logcabin <Seluin> It's not even a substance you take in.,
16:35:57 #logcabin <Seluin> But it can utterly ruin you.

18:30:37 #toronto <atv> doesn't say anything about that
18:30:40 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> when we were interviewing people, at QAC, we tested them on Java/C/C++/C# etc if they claimed to know it
18:30:41 #toronto <atv> they're mostly a ruby shop
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth (You look short as fuck in your profile picture brah)
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Brad Cikana Okay, I'm stupid and short.
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth I hate short guys srs they are so beta and they know it I wish they were sterilized so future generations didn't have to put up with such bitches.
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Brad Cikana Lol!!!!!! What is it with people on Facebook lately? If you must know, I'm 5'9" so if that's short in your opinion, so be it.
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth No you're like 5'6"
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth Remeasure your height as your comment makes no sense. I can easily look at your profile picture and tell that you have very short limbs, putting you at or below 5'6". David Duchovny from the X-Files can confirm this.
18:31:07 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth (If you're not 5'10.5" you should be sterilized)
18:31:08 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth I'm 6'2" but I'm only 16 years old
18:31:09 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> i dont know why people are semi nice to him
18:31:09 #logcabin <Seluin> Brad Cikana That's fantastic, Kyle. You have a bright future ahead of you.
18:31:11 #logcabin <Seluin> Kyle Ruth I'm automatically given alpha status in public conversations etc. over manlets like you. Srs
18:31:14 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> interesting
18:31:16 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> is it because he's clearly challenged or something?
18:31:18 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> different type of testing then
18:31:21 #toronto <atv> p much it's a place i would like to work at, and i'd be fine with the job if it's at least passably engaging
18:31:28 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> but theres that other guy that posts the vids of him "curling 1000 lbs" and he is clearly disabled in some way
18:31:34 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> and people give that guy way more crap
18:31:39 #toronto <atv> and hopefully i'd learn some shit and be able to stick around and move into a different dev position

19:19:04 #logcabin <thongphone> The FM station was NPR, no idea what the AM stations were 
19:20:01 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> idk i was just bored so i went on a cleanup, deleted a bunch of duplicate <html ... > tags and fixed some malformed tags that were still somehow rendering

20:28:16 #whitelodge <[DICKS]suckem> *Bow chicka wow wow*
20:28:35 #toronto <teethgrindr> The F-35 actually goes against that ... but it's the main reason people are opposed to it >_<

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
20:32:15 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> its that the US can use single-engine jets over their mainland since theyre high up and can always get to an airport, usually
20:32:27 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> in Canada's north, you lose an engine, you lose a jet.
20:32:56 #toronto <nupogodi_alt> and most of what we use our shit for, other than pissing off the Russians near Ukraine, is patrolling the north

00:44:20 #logcabin <in4m> university slave
00:44:22 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: if you're in the same boat the best thing you can do is research :/
00:44:34 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: you have to go talk to other people in the same job at different places and find ways to get evidence on what other people make
00:44:38 #logcabin <hc-ipad> unfortunately I can't ask for a raise
00:44:41 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and then present it and be like "everyone else gets X"
00:44:59 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> you guys get screwed so hard
00:44:59 #logcabin <BurritoDong> if you're not the kind of personality that likes to dominate a negotiation it's REALLY hard
00:45:11 #logcabin <hc-ipad> since we are a state-funded library/school there are many many tricksy things preventing us from getting raises 
00:45:23 #logcabin <BurritoDong> are salaries open books there? a lot of state schools do that
00:45:28 #logcabin <BurritoDong> so you can at least see if you're fucked compared to other people

00:45:39 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: I had a really weird experience, I applied for a job at harvard on monday, a management job
00:45:43 #logcabin <hc-ipad> you can only get a raise if you apply for a "merit" raise (submitting a portfolio) and that is ONLY if there is enough extra money in the budget to allow for it
00:45:48 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: and when I talked to the recruiter about money she told me outright how much the job was allowed to pay
00:45:52 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: they've never ever done that before
00:46:07 #logcabin <BurritoDong> it's weird how different things must be for managers
00:46:09 #logcabin <hc-ipad> We haven't had merit in several years. At this point the library is lucky that no one is getting laid off
00:46:17 #logcabin <hc-ipad> wow burritodong that is weird
00:46:29 #logcabin <BurritoDong> I guess it's like you're in the "cool club", the club that runs things
00:46:32 #logcabin <BurritoDong> so they don't even bullshit you
00:46:54 #logcabin <BurritoDong> it's less than I get paid now so I asked her to find out how much negotiation room there is and she hasn't got back to me
00:47:06 #logcabin <BurritoDong> If I go back to harvard I'll make the library hire you

01:46:50 #logcabin <in4m> the ninja turtles pizzas from pizza hut are p good
01:46:52 #logcabin <BurritoDong> mushrooms on pizza is so good
01:46:57 #logcabin <Pointsman> yea
01:46:57 #logcabin <Ginkage> pepperoni and jalapenos
01:47:00 #logcabin <BurritoDong> i like to get pepperoni, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms
01:47:02 #logcabin <Pointsman> especially sauteed mushrooms
01:47:05 #logcabin <Kyashi> what Ginkage said
01:47:08 #logcabin <BurritoDong> it's so good
01:47:21 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: what are you going to choose
01:47:24 #logcabin <Kyashi> it has to have jalapenos on it
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
01:47:42 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I will likely not pizza this eve burritodong
01:47:46 #logcabin <BurritoDong> eh , jalapenos aren't so great
01:47:49 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: but why :(
01:47:52 #logcabin <hc-ipad> i will likely consume joyless chicken mash
01:47:53 #logcabin <Kyashi> you're not so great!!!!
01:48:01 #logcabin <BurritoDong> chicken mash :( this is a sad friday
01:48:11 #logcabin <BurritoDong> Kyashi: I'm going to sneak a japapeno under your eyelid while you sleep!!
01:48:16 #logcabin <hc-ipad> however I like to discuss pizza as a theoretical construct
01:48:20 #logcabin <BurritoDong> if you can't eat a pizza on a friday why live
01:48:29 #logcabin <Kyashi> it will probably burn your hand right off before you get the chanc
01:48:31 #logcabin <Kyashi> e
01:48:33 #logcabin <hc-ipad> my dream pizza is double pepperoni, black olive, and pineapple
01:48:35 #logcabin <hc-ipad> namaste
01:48:40 #logcabin <BurritoDong> that's p good
01:48:52 #logcabin <Pointsman> black olive...
01:48:53 #logcabin <dv> thick cut bacon, pineapple, jalapeno
01:48:55 #logcabin <Pointsman> pineapple..
01:48:55 #logcabin <saaa> pepperoni goes so well with onions and barbeque chicken
01:48:56 #logcabin <BurritoDong> I don't know if I've done pepperoni and pineapple, but I'd be willing to flirt with that pizza

01:49:29 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I have also had the jalopepperapple which is jalopeno, pepperoni, & pineapple
01:49:38 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> the best thing about eating pizza
01:49:38 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hmmm
01:49:46 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> is when you get crazy drunk after
01:49:52 #logcabin <BurritoDong> I think tomorrow I'm going to order pizza
01:49:54 #logcabin <saaa> fried potato skins and sour cream is another good pizza topping
01:49:54 #logcabin <BurritoDong> you've ruined me
01:49:57 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> and then you vomit a sliced olive completely in tact
01:50:04 #logcabin <hc-ipad> lol
01:50:07 #logcabin <saaa> with spicy sauce and pulled pork

01:50:58 #logcabin <Pacra> word
01:51:02 #logcabin <Kyashi> never
01:51:06 #logcabin <BurritoDong> it's when you leave the place you're drinking and hit the fresh air
01:51:15 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and like, you lose all time, suddenly you're at home
01:51:21 #logcabin <hc-ipad> lol yep
01:51:22 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and you're aware you've done something awful

01:51:34 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and you're now lying on the grass outside her house
01:51:38 #logcabin <Pacra> like post drunk
01:51:41 #logcabin <hc-ipad> or sometimes you just wake up in your own backyard
01:51:41 #logcabin <BurritoDong> waiting for a taxi so you can catch a flight you're probably going to miss

01:52:09 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and I was like "why are you doing that I'm dying"
01:52:10 #logcabin <Pointsman> i remembered a guy telling me i couldn't get to the metro through that entrance

01:52:26 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and he said "you started crying when I tried to get you up and told me you were going to die without rice"
01:52:26 #logcabin <BurritoDong> I went to a NYE party about 100 miles from home and woke up at home in my own bed with my glasses smashed and missing a shoe
01:52:28 #logcabin <dv> almost got thrown off the bus

01:52:55 #logcabin <BurritoDong> the worst I ever did was get drunk in london
01:52:59 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and wake up in belgium
01:53:01 #logcabin <hc-ipad> that was the night my (ex)friend Sasha got too handsy and then peed in my bed
01:53:02 #logcabin <Pointsman> lmao
01:53:03 #logcabin <Pointsman> wow
01:53:04 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and I didn't know where I was

01:53:20 #logcabin <polygon> i don't throw up or black out ever, i just fall asleep if i am too drunk
01:53:22 #logcabin <BurritoDong> i had taken the eurostar train all the way
01:53:28 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I'm the same now polygon
01:53:36 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and then I guess walked for a bit and passed out on a bench
01:53:39 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I just drift slowly into whatever pillows are nearest

01:53:55 #logcabin <BurritoDong> Fhqwhgads: alone?
01:54:03 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> yes alone
01:54:08 #logcabin <Kyashi> the one time i got too drunk i started to freak out that i had to manually breathe then i fell asleep without pants and with my door open in my apartment
01:54:16 #logcabin <BurritoDong> Fhqwhgads: did you find your pants or just GONE?
01:54:23 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> no i found them
01:54:26 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> also found money in the pocket
01:54:29 #logcabin <hc-ipad> Once after the restaurant's holiday party I had to take a Cab of Shame to work the next day (at least I didn't drive)
01:54:30 #logcabin <BurritoDong> I never did find that fucking shoe
01:54:34 #logcabin <polygon> reminds me of the time i woke up on my bathroom floor still drunk and realized my shorts were gone
01:54:34 #logcabin <hc-ipad> threw up upon arrival
01:54:39 #logcabin <hc-ipad> set up the bar
01:54:40 #logcabin <hc-ipad> threw up again
01:54:41 #logcabin <polygon> then went out in the living room and found my friend wearing my fucking shorts
01:54:44 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: hahahahaha
01:54:48 #logcabin <polygon> she took them off my unconscious body and put them on herself
01:54:48 #logcabin <hc-ipad> had my first table
01:54:50 #logcabin <hc-ipad> threw up again
01:54:51 #logcabin <Pointsman> ahahaha
01:54:53 #logcabin <Pointsman> wow
01:55:03 #logcabin <hc-ipad> wtf polygon
01:55:05 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: we went to a casino in london at some point and we were just going to stay until 10pm but we stayed until like ... 5am
01:55:09 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: I went to sleep until 8 then tried to go to work
01:55:14 #logcabin <hc-ipad> lol
01:55:16 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: got in, typed my password wrong enough times it locked my account
01:55:19 #logcabin <polygon> tbf she tried to wake me up by jamming mdma into my nose
01:55:19 #logcabin <passthebutter> that seems impolite
01:55:20 #logcabin <BurritoDong> got up and walked out without saying a word to anyone
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
01:55:22 #logcabin <BurritoDong> and just went home
01:55:33 #logcabin <hc-ipad> omg omg
01:55:36 #logcabin <BurritoDong> polygon: that doesn't sound like a good friend
01:55:42 #logcabin <hc-ipad> one time I got blackout drunk at ComicCon
01:55:42 #logcabin <hc-ipad> with ITV
01:55:47 #logcabin <hc-ipad> who was also blackout drunk
01:55:50 #logcabin <passthebutter> her problem solving skills are questionable
01:55:52 #logcabin <polygon> well it was my house so i guess i don't need to wear pants
01:55:55 #logcabin <hc-ipad> neither of us remember how we got home
01:56:08 #logcabin <BurritoDong> hc-ipad: those are the weirdest experiences, it's like. how in the FUCK?
01:56:20 #logcabin <hc-ipad> I just remember getting up to pay my bar tab and coming back to the table to find that she and all of our stuff was gone
01:56:21 #logcabin <BurritoDong> it's weirder when you know you would have no idea how to get home
01:56:33 #logcabin <BurritoDong> when I was 17 some irish girls in the hotel we were on vacation in
01:56:35 #logcabin <BurritoDong> offered to take me drink
01:56:35 #logcabin <hc-ipad> and the person we'd been drinking with was like "Oh yeah your friend just took off?"
01:56:44 #logcabin <hc-ipad> She grabbed my purse, my phone, and her purse
01:56:47 #logcabin <hc-ipad> but managed to leave her phone
01:56:50 #logcabin <BurritoDong> all I remember is throwing up in the hotel lobby plant pot and then my dad had to stay awake with me all night to make sure I didn't die
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
01:56:56 #logcabin <BurritoDong> morale of this: do not try to drink irish girls under any tables
01:57:01 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> yeah
01:57:07 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> the irish will bury you
01:57:13 #logcabin <Pointsman> unless you're actually
01:57:15 #logcabin <Pointsman> pouring your drinks
01:57:17 #logcabin <Pointsman> under the table
01:57:28 #logcabin <BurritoDong> like I am pretty sure a 14 year old irish girl
01:57:28 #logcabin <Pointsman> then maybe you stand a chance
01:57:33 #logcabin <BurritoDong> could drink any of us out
01:57:53 #logcabin <polygon> maybe even me after dry july is done and i have no tolerance left
01:57:56 #logcabin <polygon> =____=
01:57:57 #logcabin <LifeSpan-Void> i can put away a 5th of most spirits in a night

02:25:25 #whitelodge <dv> lsv you public cunt
02:25:33 #logcabin <saaa> if that kind of voltage goes through your torso your odds of survival are not good because it cooks your organs and they fail
02:25:44 #logcabin <Pointsman> it seems like his brain/heart are fine by MRI but they don't quite know for sure
02:25:49 #logcabin <Pointsman> saaa: yeah, and there was arc flash too
02:25:55 #hugcabin <Panthra> :'( just wanna hang with my Bros and he's keeps popping up and ruining any banter 
02:25:59 #logcabin <Pointsman> didn't burn his face, minor burns on arm
02:26:17 #logcabin <Pointsman> it's kind of remarkable, i don't know if it managed to not go through his torso or head
02:26:18 #whitelodge <BurritoDong> lsv stepping up to a man's work
02:26:23 #logcabin <saaa> i talked to a guy who survived a 22kv shock because they packed him in ice 
02:26:33 #logcabin <Pointsman> and he clenched on, didn't get blown back

02:26:55 #logcabin <Pointsman> passthebutter: someone was killed at the Cory mine earlier this year
02:26:58 #logcabin <Pointsman> in february i think
02:27:01 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> I am now hearing another version of the Gaston song on disney radio
02:27:02 #logcabin <Pointsman> because of ground fall
02:27:02 #logcabin <saaa> they're like firefighters 
02:27:06 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> and it still reminds me of natefalls
02:27:10 #logcabin <passthebutter> a ground fall?

02:27:15 #hugcabin <Pointsman> yes plz hang with us
02:27:20 #logcabin <simmyb> i guy i used to work with showed me a video of him standing in front of a motor controller that arc flashed
02:27:22 #whitelodge <Kyashi> saved us all from more school
02:27:23 #hugcabin <Seluin> yeah!!!
02:27:27 #hugcabin <Seluin> hug cabin is for cool people
02:27:30 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> every time I hear this song it's like a music video playing in my head of natefalls ripping his shirt off and eating eggs
02:27:31 #logcabin <simmyb> he spent 4 weeks in hosptial, almost died etc
02:27:37 #logcabin <passthebutter> oh Im not saying anything poor about rescue, Im just curious if there is a bad safety record as is implied in the comments
02:27:42 #logcabin <Pointsman> passthebutter: a collapse
02:27:44 #hugcabin <Panthra> You should tell him that it'd make him happy 
02:27:49 #whitelodge <passthebutter> wow yeah
02:27:52 #logcabin <Pointsman> simmyb: arc flash is fucking terrifying
02:27:54 #whitelodge <passthebutter> that was harsh but
02:27:56 #logcabin <saaa> i'm kinda surprised some dude in canada got arc flashed, america is way more concerned with arc flash safety than europe/elsewhere
02:28:01 #whitelodge <passthebutter> maybe fixed the problem?
02:28:07 #whitelodge <BurritoDong> someone should have told him schools out for the summer
02:28:17 #logcabin <Pointsman> i'm surprised he didn't get burned worse
02:28:20 #logcabin <simmyb> yeah some of these thinks are a cool 2-3MW

04:53:22 #hugcabin <Pointsman> i haven't even touched oracle proper for almost 8 months now
04:53:27 #hugcabin <Panthlet> Actually I have Stockholm syndrome now I lov it
04:53:36 #logcabin <passthebutter> sadly my internet background video of late has been me marathoning whatever cool woodworking videos I can find
04:53:36 #hugcabin <Panthlet> I drank the Kool aid 
04:53:52 #hugcabin <Pointsman> but a big portion of my job is converting tons and tons and tons of data into a format suitable for mass uploading into oracle when the site changes over
04:54:24 #logcabin <carboncopy> what have you seen that's good?
04:54:28 #hugcabin <Pointsman> so one part writing code to do it for me, one part sifting through this stuff doing things that a human needs to do
04:54:33 #logcabin <dv> mostly i just find out when movies are coming out so i can pirate them :ssh:
04:54:39 #logcabin <carboncopy> i like the woodwright's shop, especially when he shows metal working

05:00:02 #hugcabin <Pointsman> dealing with a billion requests for password resets and new permissions
05:00:20 #logcabin <passthebutter> he has a program online you can set up how many teeth, what size, and print out a template

05:00:38 #hugcabin <Pointsman> never complain

05:03:27 #hugcabin <Panthlet> Ya your Oracle is for a business the size of a business that actually needs Oracle probably.... 
05:03:29 #logcabin <passthebutter> he has a newer more complicated thing
05:03:42 #hugcabin <Panthlet> We are still growing into Oracle 
05:03:53 #logcabin <carboncopy> i wonder why he took up wood working and not machine shop

05:09:05 #hugcabin <Panthlet> We use it for everything. So opportunities, quotes, rfqs to vendors, part numbers, shipping, jobs, pricing, project tracking, engineering drawings and ecns

05:09:58 #logcabin <helloclarice> what kind of mini donut erica_
05:10:04 #hugcabin <Panthlet> Probably more than that but that's what I use it for! 
05:10:10 #hugcabin <Pointsman> do you constantly have to change responsibilities to do different things or are they more or less all-encompassing?

05:10:20 #logcabin <Erica__> Cinnamon sugar ones!
05:10:22 #hugcabin <Panthlet> Yes I change from two different roles constantly 
05:10:26 #hugcabin <Pointsman> because i remember frequently having to change from say a inventory requestor to some other slightly different role
05:10:30 #hugcabin <Pointsman> such a pain, eh?
05:10:32 #logcabin <Erica__> And you watch them be made!

05:20:08 #logcabin <helloclarice> i would share a donut

16:10:31 #whitelodge <passthebutter> very cool idea
16:10:33 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> in the previous experiments only teenagers and pregnant women worked less
16:10:49 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> it just eases a lot of the stress of having to work to eat, like, a lot of people can't quit their job or start their own business
16:10:52 #whitelodge <passthebutter> yeah everyone still worked to make more money, stimulated economy
16:10:53 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> for fear of dying in the gutter
16:11:01 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> if they just give you a bunch of money up front you have a huge safety net

16:34:53 #whitelodge <Kyashi> im pretty sure getting a govt job involves years of trying
16:34:55 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> fuck it just watch dudes jo on cam and get $1400 then get your degree, anything else involves too much damn work

16:36:20 #whitelodge <Kyashi> i was gonna say it relies on being cute but ive seen old people on there so no it doesnt
16:36:21 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> who buys spit
16:36:38 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> 90% of being a cam person is actually more just like, pretending you like some lonely dude
16:36:42 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> while he funnels his life savings to you
16:36:53 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> i guess it's similar to being a stripper, they are paying for you to talk to them most of the time

16:37:52 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> that's what lila did
16:38:32 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> you just gotta nab some old fashioned dude who wants you to stay home all day and do boring house shit

16:39:17 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> yeah, that's unfun, kids suck
16:39:31 #whitelodge <Kyashi> really gonna ruin the mileage on my vagina
16:39:57 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> can you still get paid to like, work phone sex lines
16:40:04 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> that sounds even easier than cam shit
16:40:11 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> just fake giving an orgasm every so often and collect a paycheck
16:40:20 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> I bet you can do that shit from your bedroom these days
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
16:40:40 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> and nobody can see you, even better
16:41:10 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> basically without a degree pervy shit is the easiest and fastest way to make a ton of money to get your degree
16:41:22 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> anything else means interacting with idiots in public
16:41:24 #whitelodge <Kyashi> p much but i dont want to
16:41:30 #whitelodge <Kyashi> do sex work
16:41:45 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> yeah i can't imagine it's anything but shitty and tedious
16:41:53 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> i guess there's no way to escape doing something shitty and tedious no matter what you apply for

16:42:33 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> when you start a business with dad's money
16:42:53 #whitelodge <BurritoKing> shame on you for not doing that
16:43:27 #whitelodge <Kyashi> its like gotta get a degree without any obstacles like getting preg too soon and then your degree has to be useful and hopefully you got it for free or cheap or else game over

18:24:28 #whitelodge <passthebutter> theres nothing wrong with that, as long as youre reaching for them
18:24:32 #whitelodge <passthebutter> vs stoppin early because of them
18:24:48 #whitelodge <DennyV> haha yeah, one of the things i really like about big pyramids like that is how much it must mindfuck ppl to see me struggling with like a 20lb db
18:24:48 #whitelodge <passthebutter> unless say, youre on a progressive program where stuff moves weekly
18:24:52 #whitelodge <DennyV> for bennch
18:24:52 #whitelodge <passthebutter> and you might need that energy

18:25:27 #whitelodge <passthebutter> but Im seeing more shoulder striations now, and a lil vasc is starting to pop
18:25:36 #whitelodge <DennyV> which is funny to me bc thats were my lateral raise pyramid starts
18:25:52 #whitelodge <DennyV> and if i can get 5+ reps out of the 25s on the way up my day has been made
18:25:56 #whitelodge <passthebutter> I started mine at 25, went up to 45, then back down to 15s

01:49:59 #logcabin <WasianChickn> HOW DID YOU GAIN WEIGHT WITHOUT STEROIDS
01:50:08 #logcabin <Panthlet> I was like these could be 4 Pointsmen in the making 
01:50:08 #logcabin <WasianChickn> most popular question

01:50:33 #logcabin <Panthlet> Ya I wanted to reach out to them 
01:50:33 #logcabin <Pointsman> watching regulars at the gym go on cycle always blows my mind
01:50:35 #logcabin <SharksBelow> i am so sure my doctor is gonna tell me to diet on thursday
01:50:36 #logcabin <WasianChickn> they must fight

01:51:02 #logcabin <WasianChickn> won't say shit
01:51:04 #logcabin <SharksBelow> yeah it might be time to see a different doctor for this particular issue
01:51:05 #logcabin <Seluin> Cycles sounds awesome
01:51:11 #logcabin <polygon> sharks i thought the doc found something in the blood test results?
01:51:11 #logcabin <Boogan> lots of guys who are supre jacked and then suddenly look like normal 'i work out' guys
01:51:15 #logcabin <SharksBelow> yes
01:51:19 #logcabin <polygon> did you already hear back on what it was?
01:51:21 #logcabin <SharksBelow> she found high cholesterol and sluggish hormones
01:51:22 #logcabin <polygon> other than cholesterol
01:51:27 #logcabin <SharksBelow> and i have to go see her on thursday about it
01:51:27 #logcabin <polygon> but what does sluggish hormones mean
01:51:30 #logcabin <polygon> low TSH or....
01:51:35 #logcabin <SharksBelow> i dont know fffffffffffff i'm not a doctor!
01:51:39 #logcabin <polygon> ._.
01:51:43 #logcabin <Erica_> Hormones are the worst :(

01:52:02 #logcabin <Erica_> I also really want to get off bc to stop putting them in my body :(
01:52:09 #logcabin <cortez> this is horrific
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
01:52:17 #logcabin <SharksBelow> she said 'leigh has said here that your hormones are indeed a bit sluggish. but she is really concerned about your high cholesterol'
01:52:23 #logcabin <Panthlet> I stopped taking bc a couple weeks ago I'm now a horndog
01:52:26 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> hormones are amazing
01:52:44 #logcabin <SharksBelow> so i would say that maybe my TSH is a little on the low side but not too bad
01:52:51 #logcabin <Pointsman> someone at work the other day asked me about the difference b/w an enyzme and a hormone when they heard i had a biochem degree
01:52:55 #logcabin <polygon> weird sharks i'm sure they'll give you the breakdown when you go in though
01:52:56 #logcabin <SharksBelow> which is obv good news no one wants an underactive thyroid
01:52:59 #logcabin <SharksBelow> yeah
01:53:00 #logcabin <Erica_> I'm going to have a serious talk with my husband about getting snipped 
01:53:06 #logcabin <Erica_> We never want kids
01:53:11 #logcabin <polygon> pointsman when that happens i cry a little inside
01:53:12 #logcabin <SharksBelow> i am just not looking forward to 'you have to stop eating fat'
01:53:16 #logcabin <cortez> man i walked deep into #womentalk
01:53:22 #logcabin <Pointsman> polygon: hahahaha
01:53:23 #logcabin * cortez slowly backs away
01:53:29 #logcabin <in4m> Pointsman: what is the difference between a cell and a block of cheese?
01:53:32 #logcabin <hellocla_> poor cortez
01:53:33 #logcabin <SharksBelow> because i think she is a bit diet-crazy, she lost tonnes of weight and is quite thin in a way i dont really think looks healthy but w/e
01:53:39 #logcabin <hellocla_> its so scary when women talk about things
01:53:42 #logcabin <thongbutt> Pointsman: just tell them you have no idea, you just paid someone to do all of your classwork for you
01:53:43 #logcabin <SharksBelow> yeah

01:53:53 #logcabin <hellocla_> like the babies that come out of their bodies
01:53:53 #logcabin <Seluin> Cholesterol is weird
01:53:54 #logcabin <Erica_> I thought doctors were supposed to be like anti diet
01:53:57 #logcabin <Pointsman> polygon: but you do know the answer to that question right?
01:54:01 #logcabin <polygon> of course
01:54:03 #logcabin <polygon> just testing u
01:54:04 #logcabin <SharksBelow> Erica_: i might be being unfair to her
01:54:27 #logcabin <SharksBelow> Erica_: but if my cholesterol is high i doubt she's going to be like 'DO NOT EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT'
01:54:29 #logcabin <Pointsman> on the scale of biochem jokes from nerdy to not nerdy at all
01:54:31 #logcabin <SharksBelow> i hope she gives me NSAIDS
01:54:33 #logcabin <Erica_> I don't like 98% of the doctors I've met
01:54:36 #logcabin <Pointsman> that one's pretty strongly on the not that nerdy side

02:09:58 #logcabin <thongbutt> where in VA
02:09:58 #logcabin <Panthlet> Sorry I dunno if it's a conscious non smoking thing or something! 
02:10:00 #logcabin <polygon> seluin come over
02:10:05 #logcabin <Seluin> I will probably never do it...idk
02:10:08 #logcabin <SharksBelow> yeah coke was my drug of choice :)~
02:10:10 #logcabin <Seluin> I worry I'll like it too much
02:10:10 #logcabin <polygon> why not?
02:10:13 #logcabin <Pointsmook> i think it all comes down to what you want to get out of drugs
02:10:14 #logcabin <Buzkashi> my ex right after college was a huuuuuuuge cokehead
02:10:17 #logcabin <cortez> Seluin: let;s do coke
02:10:20 #logcabin <Buzkashi> and she was a big weirdo
02:10:25 #logcabin <Buzkashi> it massively turned me off of it
02:10:25 #logcabin <Erica_> MDMA is easily the best drug
02:10:28 #whitelodge <WasianChickn> help
02:10:29 #logcabin <Seluin> I get easily addicted to things
02:10:30 #whitelodge <WasianChickn> i dont do coke

02:10:35 #logcabin <SharksBelow> my favourite thing about coke was not hating myself whilst on it
02:10:37 #logcabin <polygon> i like the drugs that are completely not fun so i feel justified in liking coke 
02:10:37 #logcabin <Boogan> unless youre around people that are using it
02:10:38 #logcabin <Boogan> its weird
02:10:42 #logcabin <Boogan> but i guess that goes for most drugs
02:10:45 #logcabin <Panthlet> Are you addicted to me... 
02:10:50 #whitelodge <hellocla_> same

02:13:57 #whitelodge <Pointsmook> (let's not)
02:14:12 #logcabin <polygon> i feel like i smashed my ego into a thousand tiny pieces and realized that nothing matters
02:14:16 #whitelodge <passthebutter> I recently watched through the entire robocop fan remake thing.  it had a pretttty nice 80s coke party in it
02:14:18 #logcabin <polygon> that's how i became a nihilist forever

02:14:31 #logcabin <polygon> hehe
02:14:32 #logcabin <cortez> i could trip with my lil bro i guess, he was on shrooms a lot when we went to bonnaroo
02:14:39 #logcabin <Pointsmook> it's funny how you get such different reactions
02:14:41 #logcabin <Clownbabby> tripping sounds weird

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
02:14:58 #hugcabin <Clownbabby> I boughten some new boots from h&m they are rad
02:15:14 #logcabin <polygon> from the ages of 19-22 i was blasting psychedelic drugs constantly
02:15:16 #logcabin <Pointsmook> generally, any psychedelic experience i've had i would describe as uniformly positive, even if some of them were very difficult
02:15:21 #logcabin <polygon> like at least 1x a week
02:15:27 #logcabin <polygon> yes, they were positive
02:15:29 #logcabin <polygon> even the bad trips
02:15:32 #logcabin <Seluin> Pointsmook: Difficult how?
02:15:35 #logcabin <Pointsmook> yeah, exactly
02:15:39 #logcabin <Erica_> Next goon haus will be drug haus
02:15:41 #logcabin <Pointsmook> the bad trips are the most valuable ones imo
02:15:44 #logcabin <cortez> ive had bad times on weed tho i can’t imagine a bad time on a real psychoactive
02:15:44 #logcabin <polygon> if it was bad, it was because i found something inside myself that i was hiding from myself
02:15:53 #logcabin <Pointsmook> Seluin: uh it's like
02:15:56 #logcabin <passthebutter> cheetos?
02:15:56 #logcabin <Buzkashi> hrmmmmmmm
02:16:01 #logcabin <polygon> i don't really feel i have any hiding places left in my brain for bad things i wish i didn't think, remember or feel
02:16:03 #logcabin <Buzkashi> I might see if I can get some lorazepam 
02:16:06 #whitelodge <Panthlet> I'm lmao at Cortez have bad trips on weed 
02:16:08 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Hahaha 
02:16:11 #logcabin <Buzkashi> because taking one of those and then a shower is like
02:16:11 #logcabin <Buzkashi> magical
02:16:16 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Killing me

02:16:32 #logcabin <Pointsmook> and then you're forced to confront all of your flaws

02:16:35 #logcabin <polygon> yes
02:16:36 #logcabin <Buzkashi> seluin antianxiety
02:16:36 #logcabin <Seluin> Interesting
02:16:37 #logcabin <polygon> agreed points
02:16:39 #logcabin <Erica_> I has those for anxiety and it just made it so I wasn't crying at work
02:16:40 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> drug chat making me uncomfortable as heck oh manm
02:16:41 #logcabin <SharksBelow> also ecstasy showers purely for sensation
02:16:45 #logcabin <Buzkashi> erica same hahahah
02:16:49 #logcabin <Erica_> It didn't do anything close to getting me high
02:16:52 #logcabin <polygon> yeah that too sharks
02:16:56 #logcabin <Seluin> Pointsmook: I would like to experience that
02:16:56 #logcabin <Buzkashi> it's not intense or anything
02:16:57 #logcabin <Erica_> And I would still be miserable
02:16:58 #logcabin <Pointsmook> you can get some pretty weird situations going on
02:17:01 #logcabin <SharksBelow> smashtcrusht: same a little bit, esp goonhaus drugchat
02:17:02 #logcabin <Buzkashi> just relaxing
02:17:12 #whitelodge <Seluin> TOO CHILL
02:17:19 #logcabin <Erica_> Maybe my anxiety was just THAT STRONG
02:17:20 #logcabin <Pointsmook> i remember trying dpt for the first time, expecting that i'd be getting a bit past a threshold dose
02:17:24 #logcabin <Buzkashi> it might have been!
02:17:26 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Well I guess edibles can fuck you p bad but it's not like psychedelics imo 
02:17:27 #logcabin <Buzkashi> I just had like
02:17:29 #logcabin <Buzkashi> ruminant thoughts
02:17:41 #logcabin <Erica_> Probably. Last year was the worst year of my life :( 
02:17:43 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> one time i took a half a percocet ???? when my wisdom teeth got sawed out of my jaws?  am i in the club can i be in
02:17:44 #logcabin <Buzkashi> =/
02:17:46 #whitelodge <hellocla_> my first weed experience was very bad
02:17:49 #whitelodge <passthebutter> I knew a guy who quit weed because he started getting super paranoid over it
02:17:49 #logcabin <Buzkashi> well I'm glad it's over erica
02:17:50 #logcabin <Pointsmook> and suddenly everything was melting and chrysanthemumming, every pattern i could see was gyrating, and i was wondering if i was dying
02:17:51 #logcabin <Erica_> And that's when they gave me the rx
02:17:52 #logcabin <Pointsmook> and i was like
02:17:54 #logcabin <Pointsmook> let's go with this
02:17:54 #logcabin <cortez> why do drugs make you uncomfortable smashtcrusht 
02:17:56 #whitelodge <passthebutter> but that was an over time thing
02:17:58 #logcabin <Panthlet> I wanna do psychedelics with my goon Bros... 
02:18:02 #whitelodge <WasianChickn> does cortez ever have a good experience with anything
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
02:18:06 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Lol
02:18:08 #whitelodge <hellocla_> i ate A LOT of weed cookies and spun around head over heels in my brain for like 5 hrs
02:18:11 #logcabin <polygon> my advice would be if you wanna try psychedelic drugs, start with something that pushes positive if you can and have buddies around who know what's up
02:18:13 #whitelodge <hellocla_> i threw up all night and all the next day
02:18:15 #logcabin <Erica_> Me too. I'm still anxious over things like money, but a lot of the rest of it is getting better :)
02:18:20 #whitelodge <passthebutter> oh wow that sounds horrible
02:18:25 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Ya edibles always the bad times 
02:18:36 quit -!- Linguica has quit [Ping timeout: 184 seconds]
02:18:37 #whitelodge <Panthlet> Gotta be v careful 
02:18:39 #logcabin <Pointsmook> and then immediately, i felt like some divine force was washing over me and it was just waves of spiritual power washing over me
02:18:42 #whitelodge <hellocla_> also: don't crossfade unless ur experienced
02:18:46 #logcabin <Pointsmook> it was pretty wild, not what i expected out of that dose
02:18:48 #logcabin <polygon> points i had a mushroom trip where i actually believed i was dead
02:18:48 #whitelodge <Panthlet> It's hard when you are high and wanna eat more cookies tho.... 
02:18:49 #logcabin <Seluin> polygon: Yeah, I'd want to be with people I know and trust, in a good head state, and with no other plans for that day
02:18:53 #logcabin <polygon> 5g of shrooms into tea
02:18:59 #whitelodge <passthebutter> the worst drinking experience I had was turning 21 (obv) and I discovered I dont black out.  I just get sick until I dry heave and I dont pass out ever, so I figured drugs were probably a bad idea
02:19:09 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> cortez, one of the few areas convos can go that i am literally completley out of my depth in
02:19:13 #logcabin <Pointsmook> i don't believe in god or anything, so it just amazes me that it dials into whatever part of the brain is responsible for religious experience so effectively
02:19:15 #logcabin <Clownbabby> I had a friend who said shrooms was the worst experience of her life
02:19:17 #logcabin <smashtcrusht> like haha yah what drugs *blank stare*
02:19:19 #logcabin <cortez> ah
02:19:23 #whitelodge <Pointsmook> yeah, that sounds awful
02:19:27 #logcabin <polygon> pointsmook did you mean DMT not dpt?
02:19:31 #logcabin <polygon> if so i 100% agree

02:19:45 #whitelodge <hellocla_> i love crossfading now but its a balance
02:19:51 #logcabin <Clownbabby> ALso lol the vet said my dog is 100% blind
02:19:53 #whitelodge <passthebutter> my buddy I was with dropped me off in the back of his pickup.  he was also drunk, he went back downtown to have fun while I puked it up
02:19:54 #whitelodge <Seluin> I felt like I was progressing through different levels of consciousness
02:19:57 #logcabin <Pointsmook> 30 mg up the nose, i think i'm just super sensitive to it
02:19:58 #logcabin <Erica_> I would live to try more hallucinogens. I just have no idea where to find them :(
02:19:58 #whitelodge <hellocla_> you can't get REALLY drunk or REALLY high you just say level thru both
02:19:59 #whitelodge <passthebutter> then the next day he made me hose it out

02:25:55 #logcabin <cortez> interesting
02:25:56 #logcabin <polygon> young earth creationists + native american that take peyote

03:41:13 #toronto <Tighclops> well we're not on the brink of nuclear apocalypse right now 
03:41:17 #logcabin <Buzkashi> of your sausage pizza
03:41:21 #toronto <teethgrinder> that's my point
03:41:32 #toronto <teethgrinder> as much as people would like to believe that wasn't TRULY the case
03:41:33 #hugcabin <Clownbabby> oh yeah!
03:41:36 #toronto <teethgrinder> I think it really was
03:41:37 #hugcabin <Clownbabby> oh man I love that thing
03:41:43 #hugcabin <Clownbabby> I always order it if it's on a menu
03:41:47 #toronto <Tighclops> I'm amazed we're still here honestly
03:41:54 #logcabin <Clownbabby> was she naked
03:41:56 #toronto <lonegoat> also does that girl in the back have a drilldo?
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
03:41:59 #toronto <Tighclops> there were probably many more close calls than the ones we know about
03:42:04 #toronto <teethgrinder> the saving grace is we're all human for better or for worse
03:42:11 #toronto <teethgrinder> Tighclops, yeah, and we know about a lot
03:42:17 #toronto <teethgrinder> and some really fascinating covert ops
03:42:19 #logcabin <Tenchrono> Nah that's breaking the health code 
03:42:20 #logcabin <Buzkashi> lol
03:42:31 #logcabin <Buzkashi> the most tenuous of links
03:42:45 #toronto <teethgrinder> like a US research expedition somehow managing to covertly raise a lost Soviet sub
03:42:53 #toronto <teethgrinder> "research expedition"
03:42:55 #logcabin <Clownbabby> nothing healthier than being naked imo
03:42:56 #logcabin <Buzkashi> like that episode of community where no matter what happens chevy chase forces being able to tell a story about nailing eartha kitt
03:42:56 #toronto <Tighclops> hahah yeah that one was pretty insane
03:43:09 #toronto <Tighclops> where they literally parked the boat over where the sub was
03:43:26 #toronto <Tighclops> what I miss the most is when they used to shoot guys at the moon 
03:43:26 #toronto <teethgrinder> but I guess the thing was, the Russians really had no idea where they lost their sub

03:45:27 #hugcabin <Clownbabby> gotta fold some laundry first I hate doing that

03:45:36 #toronto <teethgrinder> but I was still steeped in it as a child
03:45:40 #toronto <teethgrinder> being born to Estonian parents
03:45:43 #hugcabin <Pointsmook> sleeping early is miserable
03:45:48 #toronto <teethgrinder> the weird thing is my parents claim they never pushed that stuff
03:45:48 #hugcabin <Pointsmook> i find it hard to get to bed before 10:30

03:45:55 #hugcabin <Kyashi-phone> I'm miserable

03:46:10 #toronto <teethgrinder> I was sort of raised hating Russians

17:48:54 #logcabin <Pointsman> jfc
17:49:00 #logcabin <passtheblame> use good meat and use the rendered fats from it basically?

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
17:50:00 #logcabin <passtheblame> heh cat wishing for death
17:50:06 #logcabin <Pointsman> but grass fed beef does have higher omega-3 because the plants do
17:50:22 #logcabin <Pointsman> it's like how farmed fish tend to have poor omega-6/omega-3 ratio because they're fed grains

>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
17:51:23 #logcabin <Pointsman> but yeah, you do it in oil, and as the water cooks out of the beef, you get a oil-water  emulsion and hot oil/water droplets get kicked out
17:51:36 #logcabin <passtheblame> that tends to be how my stir fry goes
17:51:49 #toronto <Tighclops> you'll find jorb :3
17:51:53 #logcabin <passtheblame> mainly because I usually use stir fry pack frozen veggis and a ton of water comes out of them

17:52:22 #logcabin <Clownbabby> cook the meat first 
17:52:25 #logcabin <Clownbabby> then do the vegies

18:00:44 #toronto <teethgrinder> but the most fun I had there was mod club
18:00:53 #toronto <teethgrinder> or industrial shows
18:00:58 #toronto <lonegoat> 25$ cover jesus
18:01:04 #logcabin <Pointsman> this week's gonna go so slow since i've got a 4 day weekend starting on friday
18:01:21 #toronto <teethgrinder> well I would never have paid $25 as a student
18:01:22 #toronto <lonegoat> well, i guess if it's a club/dj thing
18:01:29 #toronto <teethgrinder> but it also made me feel fine going and not drinking
18:01:31 #toronto <lonegoat> that's fine, since it's effectively a concert
18:01:34 #toronto <teethgrinder> so really I came out ahead
18:01:40 #logcabin <Pointsman> hello helloclarice
18:01:47 #logcabin <Panthra> hi hc
18:01:52 #logcabin <Pointsman> i think that's the first time
18:01:55 #logcabin <Pointsman> you've ever heard that joke
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:03:00 #toronto <teethgrinder> anyway I couldn't imagine going to a club as a single guy
18:03:10 #toronto <teethgrinder> just showing up by myself was awkward enough, with the bouncers
18:03:25 #logcabin <helloclarice> hi
18:03:27 #toronto <teethgrinder> but it was okay with the group
18:03:29 #logcabin <Panthra> my mom is on a mission trip with her church to jamaica. i'm dreading her return. when she comes back she shows like 200 pictures that are really uninteresting
18:03:37 #logcabin <Panthra> and she'll want to show them to me like 10 times
18:03:48 #toronto <teethgrinder> and fuck I'm glad I wasn't there when they first talked their way in
18:03:51 #logcabin <Panthra> mommmm
18:03:53 #logcabin <Pointsman> here we have a picture
18:03:55 #logcabin <Pointsman> of a tree
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:04:00 #logcabin <Pointsman> we doin't have trees like that here
18:04:02 #logcabin <Panthra> ugh yes p much
18:04:03 #toronto <teethgrinder> my fiancee could barely handle them pretending to be on the guest list
18:04:26 #logcabin <Panthra> she'll show them to me, then to my dad, then my bf will come over and she's like EIRIK YOU HAVE TO SEE THESE
18:04:36 #toronto <lonegoat> what, was she giggling or turning red or what
18:04:42 #logcabin <helloclarice> ugh
18:04:42 #logcabin <Pointsman> poor eirik
18:04:44 #logcabin <Pointsman> one removed
18:04:51 #logcabin <Pointsman> and he still has to look at pictures of trees
18:04:57 #logcabin <Panthra> ya he should dump me
18:05:01 #logcabin <Panthra> it would be better imo
18:05:14 #logcabin <Pointsman> if you married, it'd be legal basis for divorce

18:10:07 #hugcabin <Pointsman> this place could use some tidying up too
18:10:09 #logcabin <Panthra> kyashi you can put dollar bills into vending machines and then coin return button it will give you coins
18:10:14 #hugcabin <helloclarice> like in a real "pick up shit off the floor" way but also in a "get you life together, son" way
18:10:15 #hugcabin <Panthra> just light it on fire
18:10:23 #logcabin <Kyashi> i dont have dollar bills either lol
18:10:26 #logcabin <in4m> and also I'm pretty sure you can go to any bank and exchange money for money
18:10:28 #logcabin <Panthra> damnit kyashi get it together
18:10:30 #hugcabin <Pointsman> i need to get a dust buster or something
18:10:42 #hugcabin <Pointsman> because this vacuum cleaner we have is very inadequate
18:10:51 #logcabin <Kyashi> cash sucks!!!
18:11:00 #hugcabin <Panthra> my house is clean for a recor 3 days because my mom is gone
18:11:18 #logcabin <Panthra> just rob a bank 
18:11:20 #toronto <teethgrinder> I wasn't there
18:11:21 #hugcabin <Pointsman> do you have a board that says _ days without a mess
18:11:33 #toronto <teethgrinder> but it was uncomfortable from what I understand
18:11:34 #hugcabin <Pointsman> like how places have _ days without a lost time incident
18:11:34 #logcabin <Panthra> coins only please and keep your sacajawea coins to yourself....

18:11:39 #hugcabin <Panthra> yes
18:11:47 #toronto <teethgrinder> also she witnessed some of the douchier aspects of guys over the night
18:11:58 #hugcabin <Pointsman> wouldn't that be the most passive aggressive way of dealing with it?  absolute amazing
18:12:00 #toronto <teethgrinder> ...mostly in our friends
18:12:02 #logcabin <Kyashi> i have tons of other useless coins but not quarters

18:12:08 #logcabin <Panthra> i know it'st he worst

18:12:15 #logcabin <Panthra> i hate when vending machines say NO DOLLAR COINS wtf man
18:12:16 #toronto <teethgrinder> well it was eye-opening even for me
18:12:18 #logcabin <Panthra> a slave to a dolla bill
18:12:21 #hugcabin <helloclarice> gotta get some real food up in here and stop treating my stomach like a trash can 
18:12:30 #toronto <teethgrinder> one guy went into the whole PUA spiel of negging and shit
18:12:38 #toronto <Tighclops> eww
18:12:39 #toronto <lonegoat> how did that work out for him
18:12:41 #yossec <zylch> should be just post
18:12:44 #toronto <teethgrinder> had no idea he was like that prior
18:12:53 #toronto <teethgrinder> he was acting repentent
18:13:01 #toronto <teethgrinder> like he's better than that now
18:13:05 #hugcabin <Pointsman> what is a stomach really
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:13:12 #hugcabin <Pointsman> but a trash compactor for organic material
18:13:22 #toronto <teethgrinder> from the little I've seen, I guess it's worked out well for him
18:13:43 #toronto <teethgrinder> but he's between "picking up" and "meeting a nice girl"
18:13:46 #toronto <lonegoat> "now" being 12 hours later?
18:13:49 #toronto <Tighclops> men are bad do not men 
18:13:50 #toronto <DrN> Alright. I am spilling out amazing ideas for this Promotions Assistant job at Humber
18:13:57 #logcabin <Pointsman> do you still have dollar bills in the states?
18:13:57 #toronto <DrN> If I don't get it I am going to be super pissed
18:14:01 #toronto <teethgrinder> he's made a good impression on several of Heather's friends
18:14:09 #toronto <teethgrinder> not picking up, just dating
18:14:11 #logcabin <Kyashi> yes
18:14:12 #toronto <lonegoat> why are you giving away ideas before you have the job
18:14:12 #toronto <DrN> I would also be pissed off if I didn't get that event planner job
18:14:18 #logcabin <Pointsman> wow what a backwards society
18:14:20 #toronto <teethgrinder> haha
18:14:22 #toronto <DrN> SEEING THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN IT. 
18:14:24 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> dolla dolla bill yall
18:14:24 #logcabin <Panthra> it's the only denomination of $1 that is reallly used or accepted
18:14:30 #logcabin <Panthra> it sucks!
18:14:32 #logcabin <Kyashi> why would we want more coins
18:14:34 #toronto <teethgrinder> I have a good friend who is a professional event planner
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:14:44 #logcabin <Panthra> there's a lot of benefits to dollar coins
18:14:48 #toronto <teethgrinder> like NHL/NFL gigs
18:14:50 #toronto <DrN> The thing is, you need to share ideas to show your creativity. 
18:14:55 #logcabin <Panthra> most other nations have higher value coins than us
18:14:56 #logcabin <Pointsman> we have 2 dollar coins too
18:14:57 #logcabin <Pointsman> it rules
18:15:00 #toronto <lonegoat> sounds like a scam to me
18:15:18 #toronto <DrN> And as long as they're ideas that are not "lets post something on twitter" or "we can make posters"
18:15:18 #logcabin <Pointsman> no fumbling in my wallet to buy a pack of gum
18:15:20 #toronto <DrN> they are happy
18:15:22 #logcabin <Pointsman> or a coffee/muffin
18:15:28 #logcabin <helloclarice> http://i.imgur.com/xEmBevQ.jpg
18:15:28 #hugcabin <helloclarice> that's true 
18:15:28 #hugcabin <helloclarice> im trash compacting a lot of sugar lately
18:15:28 #logcabin <Linguica> yeah
18:15:32 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> why would i want to carry a pocket full of heavy coins?
18:15:37 #logcabin <in4m> jpan has a 1000 yen coin
18:15:39 #toronto <DrN> but you also have to write this as if you sharing ideas and not going in to do the actual ideas
18:15:41 #logcabin <in4m> which is about 10 bucks usd
18:15:49 #logcabin <Pointsman> just reach into my pocket, stick out a handful of shrapnel, smile, and hope i have enough to pay for it
18:15:50 #whitelodge <Kyashi> JAPAN
18:15:50 #logcabin <Linguica> the only time you ever see dollar coins if if you like. buy stamps at a stamp machine and get a bunch of change
18:16:14 #logcabin <Panthra> i'm pissed when i get a dollar coin back, because while i think we should use dollar coins, no one does! WHAT DO I DO WITH THAT
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'

18:16:39 #logcabin <Pointsman> i got into the habit of using cash for smaller stuff in montreal
18:16:42 #toronto <DrN> I kind of stole the ideas
18:16:45 #toronto <DrN> so...
18:16:49 #whitelodge <dv> panthra gets on the board
18:16:49 #logcabin <in4m> there is a bomb ass chinese place nearby that is cash only
18:16:51 #logcabin <Pointsman> so i've always got $20-100 on me
18:16:54 #toronto <Tighclops> ahahha I misread that as "would like to parkour"
18:16:56 #logcabin <Pointsman> because some places just didn't have debit
18:17:01 #toronto <lonegoat> that'd be a cool event
18:17:02 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> i dont like using cash just so it's easier to track my spending later
18:17:06 #toronto <lonegoat> i'd go to that

23:42:59 #logcabin <Kyashi> you didnt miss it
23:43:04 #hugcabin <Panthra> aw i know that feelin
23:43:07 #hugcabin <Pointsman> :(
23:43:09 #hugcabin <Pointsman> that sucks
23:43:14 #hugcabin <Panthra> i've cried before in front of boss it's not a fun feeling
23:43:15 #logcabin <Erica_> I have had both. Like smallish and then monster size
23:43:21 #logcabin <Seluin> bbf: Average is 5.5 iirc
23:43:21 #logcabin <Erica_> Both were good equally
23:43:27 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> but I kept telling her "my emotional response right now is not indicative of how upset I actually am, I just cry at the drop of a hat"
23:43:39 #hugcabin <Panthra> ya that's good i'm sure she understood
23:43:41 #logcabin <Erica_> But the guy with te big dilz def didn't try as hard and was just relying on size
23:43:42 #logcabin <bbf> seluin: yeah but i mean really not just science
23:43:43 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> yeah
23:43:44 #logcabin <Linguica> heres what the admissions director said
23:43:48 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> she didn't have any answers for me
23:43:48 #hugcabin <Panthra> what'd she have to say?
23:43:50 #logcabin <Linguica> "Yesterday I was reading applications all day and I read one from someone who had really great numbers and their personal statement was very off-putting, completely arrogant."
23:43:52 #hugcabin <Panthra> :(
23:43:58 #logcabin <bbf> i feel like science misrepresents median dilz size
23:44:07 #logcabin <Linguica> i know this guy had great numbers and the timeline matches up perfectly
23:44:08 #logcabin <Seluin> Hehhh
23:44:18 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> but she said she'd let our leader know that more clarification on the promotion and how that would affect our team in the long-term would be really good
23:44:19 #logcabin <carboncopy> does mofauxhawk have the self-awareness to think that it might be about him?
23:44:20 #logcabin <Seluin> bbf: Misrepresets it up or down?
23:44:23 #logcabin <polygon> how does it
23:44:24 #logcabin <Erica_> No, men who repeat stats wrong misrepresents penis size
23:44:26 #logcabin <polygon> there have been lots of studies
23:44:34 #logcabin <polygon> using both the stretch method and actually having the dudes get boners
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
23:44:38 #logcabin <Linguica> carboncopy: lol no he was sure it couldnt be
23:44:41 #logcabin <Linguica> his rationale was
23:44:44 #logcabin <bbf> seluin: down
23:44:50 #logcabin <Linguica> "they knew i wouldnt actually accept, so it was yield protection"
23:44:57 #logcabin <carboncopy> lmao
23:45:06 #logcabin <Pointsman> basically any study where they actually physically measured it
23:45:08 #logcabin <Ginkage> why apply if he wasn't going to accept?
23:45:09 #logcabin <Pointsman> comes out toa round 5.5
23:45:12 #hugcabin <Panthra> i'm glad you said something
23:45:12 #logcabin <Pointsman> otherwise it's bigger
23:45:17 #logcabin <polygon> yep
23:45:21 #logcabin <Ginkage> brb, getting a ruler
23:45:23 #logcabin <hc-ipad> dilz size relative to vag depth is really waht matters I guess?
23:45:31 #logcabin <bbf> 5.5 seems low
23:45:34 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> yeah me too
23:45:40 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> she also said that she was glad I'd spoken out
23:45:41 #logcabin <Kyashi> is your dilz above or below that bbf
23:45:42 #logcabin <polygon> vag depth is malleable dilz size not so much
23:45:44 #hugcabin <Panthra> :)
23:45:44 #logcabin <polygon> ehehh
23:45:46 #logcabin <carboncopy> plz do not shame dilz size bbf

23:48:13 #logcabin <Panthra> i do wanna read it
23:48:14 #logcabin <thongbutt> both at the same time, half cut, half uncut
23:48:15 #logcabin <warszawa> it was a work of art
23:48:15 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> like 30 goddamned dicks
23:48:18 #logcabin <Kyashi> ive yet to find uncut, need one for dick bingo
23:48:19 #hugcabin <Seluin> Don't let it be a, "we'll look into it"

23:48:24 #hugcabin <Seluin> And then it never goes anywhere
23:48:25 #logcabin <bbf> hc-ipad: you mean preference cuz i dont have one
23:48:32 #logcabin <Erica_> The firsts uncut one I had I was confused at first 
23:48:34 #hugcabin <hc-ipad> yeah
23:48:41 #logcabin <warszawa> it was so bad that the dean of a well-respected law school wrote a blog post to say how a personal statement can render an applicant with great credentials toxic
23:48:43 #logcabin <Erica_> But figured it out pretty quick
23:48:43 #logcabin <bbf> but i think ppl should be uncut cuz its fucked up to chop up genitals
23:48:48 #logcabin <hc-ipad> almost all of my dudez have been uncut
23:48:52 #logcabin <hc-ipad> oddly enough
23:48:56 #logcabin <Panthra> wow!

23:50:09 #logcabin <bbf> also sometimes when they circumcize dudes they mess it up
23:50:14 #logcabin <Erica_> I wonder if circumcision rates have been dropping or if they're still the same
23:50:20 #logcabin <hc-ipad> i have seen that irl also bbf 
23:50:23 #logcabin <asexual_linuxmancer> can I jus tput this entire conversation in the topic

23:50:58 #logcabin <hc-ipad> it wasn't the biggest deal ever polygon
23:51:11 #logcabin <polygon> but what was the uhhh issue?
23:51:13 #logcabin <thongbutt> uncut is more likely to contract HIV
23:51:15 #logcabin <Ginkage> but he is cut?
23:51:24 #logcabin <Ginkage> maybe that is why it seems weird to him to be uncut
23:51:33 #logcabin <Erica_> Oh, good about the dropping rates!
23:51:39 #logcabin <Seluin> Linguica: where'd that dude get into law school?
23:51:42 #logcabin <Erica_> He is cut, yes Ginkage 
23:51:48 #logcabin <hc-ipad> he had a bit of a birth defect polygon and so the circumcision was sorta halfsies
23:51:52 #logcabin <carboncopy> idk how i feel about circumscision, culturally for me i guess it makes sense, but it should probably be a lot more rare imo
23:51:55 #logcabin <bbf> i have a dick scar its unfortunate

00:01:46 #logcabin <Linguica> As perverse as that sounds, satire is certainly an effective way to help make people aware of a problem and want to fix it. I put the scripting languages I had learned in high school to use and designed a site on which I write reviews about low-income housing projects, as if they were luxury apartments, for a non-existent audience of upwardly-mobile young professionals who would want to live...

01:51:14 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice – As a joke the production reels were replaced with one long, unbroken shot of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill yelling “YOU’LL FUCKING PAY FOR ANYTHING” then drawing funny faces on their genitals, pointing them towards the camera, achieving erection, and using superhero death grip strength to squeeze all the blood into the glans until they resembled...

Critics praised Affleck’s nuanced performance as Batman, and his willingness to abuse steroids in order to provide a physical presence that could match Superman, whose penis is for all intents invincible. It became the first motion picture to gross 3 billion dollars. (220 minutes)

02:03:40 #logcabin <Pointsman> Fhqwhgads: that's a good way to sum up what goons actually believe about crossfit
02:03:42 #logcabin <Pointsman> thongbutt: that's right
02:03:51 #logcabin <thongbutt> then you also ahve the smaller plates
02:03:57 #logcabin <Pointsman> but generally it's 25/35/45/55 lbs if you do colour coding with lbs
02:04:01 #logcabin <thongbutt> but I don't remember those colors
02:04:13 #logcabin <sharks> still can't get over those 1RM ohs
02:04:17 #logcabin <thongbutt> I wanna say like small red is 5kg, green 2.5, and I forgot

02:04:54 #logcabin <thongbutt> Only place I've lifted with colored bumpers is when I worked at a high school that had a nice strength room
02:05:06 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> nah, they actually have two, round, 45s in my gym
02:05:11 #logcabin <sharks> oh nice
02:05:12 #logcabin <Fhqwhgads> so i use them...then all the hex plates
02:05:14 #logcabin <sharks> two (2)

02:06:31 #logcabin <Pointsman> no it wasn't bad
02:06:34 #logcabin <Pointsman> and another time i unracked an incline bench misloaded by 25 lbs

02:07:21 #logcabin <Pointsman> when you front squat as much as me though
02:07:24 #logcabin <Pointsman> 10 kg is a much smaller %
02:07:35 #logcabin <sharks> i stood up with the bar and nearly fell sideways,heheh

13:50:20 #whitelodge <passtheblame> is that even biomechanically possible
13:50:34 #whitelodge <passtheblame> flexing upper and not lower trap or vice versa?  I would guess no
13:50:47 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> you can emphasise
13:50:49 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> but yeah
13:50:54 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> can't isolate

13:51:39 #whitelodge <passtheblame> was debating isolating rear delts from rhomboids the other day
13:51:44 #whitelodge <passtheblame> unsure if thats even a thing
13:52:13 #whitelodge <passtheblame> Ive been busting ass on rear delts and seeing progress there, which is good, but also seeing growth on the rhomboids in between them as well.
13:52:17 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> i just like the hs shrug machine i dunno. i'm not big enough to worry about emphasizing anything
13:52:33 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> it does destroy my traps though
13:52:45 #whitelodge <passtheblame> youre doing it right imo
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
13:53:08 #whitelodge <passtheblame> and Im unsure that being big enough has shit to do with anything, as far as subtle emphasis and all that
13:53:18 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> also i noticed that there are two different pins to place weights on
13:53:30 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> and placing weights on the lower pins makes it a lot harder
13:53:43 #whitelodge <passtheblame> leverages with that particular machine Im sure

13:54:35 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> i cant find a picture of it at the moment
13:55:07 #whitelodge <passtheblame> google maps says the fastest way is to get on the 8 and drive right by the border, unsure about that/if its a decent route
13:55:08 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> but the hs shrug machine we have has like 3 spots on each side to put plates. one is just to store them, it doesnt do anything, the other two actually add weight to the lift

13:58:08 #whitelodge <passtheblame> I just try to focus on pulling up and back on shrugs
13:58:11 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> shrug machines are essential if you have access
13:58:14 #whitelodge <passtheblame> if I pull forward I do bad things to my neck
13:58:32 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> dont roll your shoulders back though
13:58:47 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> the hs shrug machine makes me lean back slighty due to the leverage
13:58:47 #whitelodge <LifeSpan-Void> always use neutral grip
13:59:00 #whitelodge <Fhqwhgads> like if i grab the lowest grips, i'm standing kinda /

17:25:44 #toronto <nupogodi_alt_> *shrug* actually its not exactly my experience, it's my friends who have worked in places that had bathrooms, but ive had that experience too. there was this one office i worked at where they had mens/womens bathrooms but they were just individual rooms that locked, so there was no real difference between them
17:25:51 #toronto <nupogodi_alt_> so i'd use the women's sometimes but it was usually clean
17:26:21 #toronto <nupogodi_alt_> also at the Tim Hortons by my parents place where i used to hang out a lot as a teen, same deal, gendered washrooms for no reason cause they locked, so i'd sometimes be forced to use the womens and it was totally gross
17:26:36 #toronto <Tighclops> you're that guy that puts cameras under all the toilet seats aren't you, you are 
17:26:51 #toronto <nupogodi_alt_> no im the guy with stomach problems who isn't going to wait around when i gotta take a massive shit

18:05:56 #logcabin <Linguica> hey mvl why does *fart++; go to the next element in an array instead of incrementing the current element
18:06:28 #logcabin <BurritoKing> because you're incrementing the pointer?
18:06:32 #logcabin <BurritoKing> I literally know nothing about C but that's my guess
18:06:41 #logcabin <BurritoKing> so you're incrementing the location in memory you're looking, not the contents of memory
>>> u'PONG :toronto.on.ca.synirc.net'
18:06:47 #logcabin <Linguica> but *fart points to the value
18:06:51 #logcabin <Linguica> at the pointer
18:07:02 #logcabin <BurritoKing> oh in that case dunno
18:07:26 #logcabin <pr0zac> its order of operations
18:07:34 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> uh oh I thanked someone on OKCupid for a bunch of specific tubing advice
18:07:35 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> ...
18:07:40 #logcabin <pr0zac> ++ has higher precidence than *
18:07:40 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> but I thanked the wrong person
18:07:43 #logcabin <Mad_Wack> :-/
18:07:53 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> yeah
18:07:56 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> pr0zac got it
18:08:03 #logcabin <Linguica> so if you wanted to increment the value would it be (*fart)++
18:08:06 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> I mean me agreeing with him is like OH YEAH THAT but

18:09:33 #logcabin <pr0zac> anyone who ever asks that question should be shot imo
18:09:37 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> probably because you're doing the same operation to both pointers?
18:09:44 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> lol
18:09:45 #logcabin <Linguica> like when c advances past the end of an array does it just "know" that it should return false at that point or w/e

18:17:53 #logcabin <pr0zac> a couple times I've had interviews where I just brought in ideas i wanted to work on someone with

18:19:52 #logcabin <Norse_Code> speaking about nerd stuff 
18:20:23 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> yeah seems like making a temp var and then throwing it to the garbage collector would be faster
18:20:30 #logcabin <pr0zac> is anyone else real excited about the new D&D 5e?
18:20:34 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> What do you mean it's p decent Norse_Code 
18:20:46 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> I haven't been excited for D&D ina  long time
18:20:48 #logcabin <Linguica> also K&R seems to teach bad habits, like one exercise was about implementing a string concatenator but it didnt even warn about expanding the string out of the space designated for it
18:20:54 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> its too different from old school D&D
18:20:59 #whitelodge <Kyashi> ugghhhhhhhhh
18:21:00 #logcabin <pr0zac> [CIS]MoistVonLipwig 4e was real bad

18:21:08 #logcabin <Linguica> so i wrote it and was like this seems wrong somehow, but it compiled fine so i was like whatever yolo
18:21:08 #logcabin <[CIS]MoistVonLipwig> it wasn't even D&D
18:21:11 #logcabin <pr0zac> im hoping 5e fixes the problems i had with 4e

18:34:48 #logcabin <Seluin> pr0zac, I dunno. I find if the numbers are there, most people feel obligated to follow them
18:34:51 #logcabin <pr0zac> but having basically rules for everything makes it possible for people to think up really ridicullous things and the DM be able to figure out what to roll to make it happen

18:35:33 #logcabin <helloclarice> this is why its really fun to create characters with Games Guy, he's the best DM. I just say "I want my character to do this and this and this" and he digs through the books and figures out the numbers

18:36:53 #logcabin <pr0zac> [CIS]MoistVonLipwig: the short version of the story is it was middle school, we all went to my friend Chris's house to play, spent 2 hours rolling up characters and start the game, Chris has us start with our characters standing in front of the king of the land while hes describing some ridiculous quest hes sending us on, part way through the monologue my friend Graham says "I attack the king", and we end up just wailing on the king and his guards and it

20:35:20 #logcabin <Panthlet> It's so weird 
20:35:36 #logcabin <WasianChickn> the acidity can be bad for your teeth, though that's mostly for excessive amounts
20:35:36 #logcabin <Seluin> aaaaa
20:35:47 #logcabin <Seluin> washing your eyes with pee
20:35:49 #logcabin <Seluin> so gross
20:35:52 #logcabin <WasianChickn> diet sodas don't have sugars though so there is less of an issue with byproducts
20:36:01 #logcabin <WasianChickn> also, drink through a straw
20:36:03 #logcabin -!- Tenchrono [~Tenchrono@439772E0:778D1D7C:71B69521:IP] has joined #logcabin
20:36:05 #logcabin <Panthlet> Seluin it's less gross if it's someone else's pee right? Let's swap
20:36:08 #logcabin <WasianChickn> unfortunately that's a bit harder with coffee...
20:36:10 #logcabin <Tenchrono> Hi goons

20:36:15 #logcabin <WasianChickn> hi goon
20:36:16 #yossec <cheese-cube> p sure you can trick it's mime type detection. if you try to upload https://imgur.com/register it eventually returns an invalid type error (text/html)
20:36:17 #logcabin <Panthlet> Hi
20:36:29 #logcabin <Panthlet> My tablet is about to die
20:36:30 #logcabin <Seluin> Panthlet, ok, that's fine
20:36:32 #logcabin <Panthlet> Gl panthlet.... 
20:36:36 #logcabin <Norse_Code> if i had to drink my own pee i would drink like 5 gallons of water beforehand
20:36:44 #yossec <sharktopus> hmmm
20:36:47 #logcabin <Norse_Code> like that pee porn we were looking at the other day
20:36:48 #yossec <sharktopus> i wonder if it follows redirects
20:36:49 #logcabin <bbf> pee back and forth forever
20:36:51 #logcabin <Seluin> hahaha
20:36:52 #yossec <sharktopus> that might be a way to generate massive traffic
20:36:54 #logcabin <Seluin> where it's just water
20:36:59 #logcabin <Panthlet> Good pee drinking strategy 
20:36:59 #logcabin <Seluin> drink straight from the tap
20:37:01 #logcabin <Norse_Code> when i thought the guy was a squirter, lol
20:37:08 #logcabin <WasianChickn> chances are if you ever have to drink your own pee
20:37:13 #logcabin <WasianChickn> you won't have water on hand
20:37:13 quit -!- Tighclops has quit [Ping timeout]
20:37:25 #logcabin <Seluin> you don't know me, WasianChickn
20:37:30 #logcabin <Seluin> you don't know how I prepare
20:37:31 #yossec <sharktopus> if you find a redirect with a side effect you might be able to loop it back on itself
